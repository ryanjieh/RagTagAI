      "Okay, a white t-shirt and grey shorts is a classic, comfortable, and versatile base! Here's how we can elevate this, keeping in mind a few different style directions:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Overall Considerations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Fit is Key:** Make sure both the t-shirt and shorts fit well. A well-fitting outfit always looks more polished.\n",
      "*   **Fabric Matters:** The fabric of both items can influence the overall feel. Linen or a cotton blend will look more breezy and casual, while performance fabrics can lean sporty.\n",
      "*   **Shoes are Important:** The shoes will drastically change the vibe.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Here are a few ways to improve it based on different styles:**\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Elevated Casual:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **T-Shirt:** Opt for a slightly heavier weight cotton t-shirt. This will drape better and look more intentional. Consider a crew neck or a v-neck depending on your preference.\n",
      "*   **Shorts:** Choose tailored grey shorts, perhaps in a chino style or a linen blend. Look for a length that hits just above the knee.\n",
      "*   **Shoes:** Clean white sneakers (think Stan Smiths, Common Projects, or similar) or leather loafers.\n",
      "*   **Accessories:** A simple leather belt (brown or black), a watch with a leather or metal band, and maybe some sunglasses.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Relaxed/Streetwear:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **T-Shirt:** An oversized or slightly longer-length white t-shirt. You could even consider a graphic tee.\n",
      "*   **Shorts:** Relaxed fit grey shorts, maybe with cargo pockets or a drawstring waist.\n",
      "*   **Shoes:** Sneakers like Air Force 1s, New Balance 550s, or Vans.\n",
      "*   **Accessories:** A baseball cap, a crossbody bag or a backpack, and some casual jewelry (bracelets, necklaces).\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Sporty/Athletic:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **T-Shirt:** A moisture-wicking athletic t-shirt.\n",
      "*   **Shorts:** Performance grey shorts (think running shorts or basketball shorts).\n",
      "*   **Shoes:** Running shoes or athletic trainers.\n",
      "*   **Accessories:** A baseball cap or visor, a sports watch, and a gym bag.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Summer/Beach Casual:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **T-Shirt:** A linen or lightweight cotton t-shirt.\n",
      "*   **Shorts:** Shorter length grey shorts, maybe in a chino or swim short style.\n",
      "*   **Shoes:** Sandals, flip-flops, or boat shoes.\n",
      "*   **Accessories:** Sunglasses, a straw hat, and a beach bag.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Specific Recommendations & Examples:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Add a Layer:** A light jacket (denim jacket, bomber jacket, or a lightweight windbreaker) can add some visual interest and warmth.\n",
      "*   **Color Pop:** Introduce a pop of color with your shoes or accessories. For example, bright sneakers or a colorful hat.\n",
      "*   **Tuck or Untuck:** Depending on the style of the t-shirt and shorts, you can try tucking in the t-shirt for a more polished look or leaving it untucked for a more relaxed vibe.\n",
      "*   **Experiment with Textures:** Try shorts with a subtle texture, like a seersucker or a pique knit.\n",
      "\n",
      "To give you the best recommendations, tell me:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **What is the occasion?** (e.g., running errands, going to a casual party, going on a date)\n",
      "*   **What is your personal style?** (e.g., classic, trendy, sporty, minimalist)\n",
      "*   **What is your budget?**\n",
