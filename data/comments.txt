IMO - Get a plain color polo, tuck it in, and get nicer shoes. Main problem here is the clashing patterns on the shirt and the jacket.

I'll give ubthat one. Sneakers could use a wash.



[–]KillYourFace5000 207 points 1 year ago 

You can basically get some of the very best shoes in the world on eBay used for pennies on the dollar. Buy a couple of pairs of oxfords in good, very good or excellent/like-new shape (depending on your budget). They'll be versatile enough to wear in a variety of settings, good for any office or professional setting, and will tend to pull together more casual, youthful outfits like that and look slicker and more professional. You can get great shoes in good shape for like $50-100.



[–]jab296 86 points 1 year ago* 

No no no this is a gateway to having a closet full of extremely nice shoes, yet working from home 95% of the time.

I spent an expensive few years on /r/goodyearwelt and now also have a closet full of extremely nice shoes and boots and, yes, I work from home as well and have no need for 75% of them.

It was all worth it though just for my pair of Edward Green rosewood country calf Galway boots. Love those freaking things!

Derbies will look much better than oxfords with this outfit



[–]KillYourFace5000 10 points 1 year ago 

Fair point - I'm just going for the Big Picture here.



[–]the_lamou 1 point 1 year ago 

Tassled loafers would look better still, and are derived from Oxfords. Check-mate!

 

[–]FirstChurchOfBrutus 5 points 1 year ago 

Tassled loafers? He said he was 50, not 80.

 

[–]the_lamou 3 points 1 year ago 

Tassled loafers have been, and still are, awesome. Trad/Ivy/American Tailoring is having a major resurgence, and tassled loafers are a critical piece of that.

 

[–]FirstChurchOfBrutus 2 points 1 year ago 

We do not agree, friend. And what you’re describing is a Prep look, and that hasn’t changed in decades. It’s absolutely fine, but it’s more like it never went anywhere than it is experiencing a resurgence.

 

[–]the_lamou 2 points 1 year ago 

"Prep" is similar to, but distinct from, Ivy and more formal American tailoring/trad. Prep would be much more aligned with penny loafers than tassled loafers, since the former is more casual and more widely associated with the Prep School crowd of the 1950's/60's (the original "preppys.") Tassled loafers, on the other hand, rose to prominence in the Ivy League students of the 20's and 30's (apocryphaly.) A penny loafer or a modern but more formal moc might work with this outfit (assuming the shirt is changed) but a tassel just classes it up from "I bought an outfit from a manaquin I saw at Vineyard Vines" to "I actually put some thought into looking like a professional adult."

And yes, the whole genre of Americana tailoring, including Ivy and Prep, is absolutely making a strong comeback. Yes, there's always an undercurrent of Abercrombie "prep" in American fashion, but just paying attention to archival PRL prices should make it clear that we're in a wave here. I've seen Polo Bear sweatahirts go from $200 to $600 for the in demand classics over the last two to three years.

 

[–]FirstChurchOfBrutus 1 point 1 year ago 

This makes me worry for the immediate future of menswear. I dress fairly conservatively, but steer well clear of stodgy. I would consider tassled loafers and the like as the latter.

Good thing we don’t all dress or think alike, though. You do you & all.

 

[–]No-Respect5903 4 points 1 year ago 

what brand(s) do you recommend?



[–]KillYourFace5000 36 points 1 year ago 

Check my last post where I link to an eBay search. As I said there, I don't know brands very well, but I know (from here) that those are all good bets.

One note suggests itself: Tons of people will recommend Allen Edmonds. Then others will jump in to let everyone know that Allen Edmonds has gone downhill in recent years in quality. It sounds like that's farily well established, but if you're used to normal people shoes, AE can still be a very good overall buy, if not quite the evergreen luxury product they might've been before, and they often go for silly low prices on eBay, where the other, "better" brands hold their value a lot more.

But ultimately we're talking about the difference between a finding good pair of shoes that retails new for like $500 for $75 in good shape and finding an amazingly good pair of shoes that retails new for like $1,800 for $300. I may nab some better ones once I'm more confident I know what I'm doing, but the AE approach is a very logical entry point.



[–]caltheme 5 points 1 year ago 

Can you repost the link? Not seeing in your post history



[–]duki512 2 points 1 year ago 

I believe this is the link to the post you're looking for.



[–]KillYourFace5000 1 point 1 year ago 

Also I'm trying to be mindful of my existing suit and separates collection: I'm slowly building separates, again, through eBay, but in the meantime, my suits are CHEAP. They're well tailored, but cheap, and I'm sure someone who knows well enough could tell they're cheap. So, I'm thinking I probably don't want to wear a brand that is known to retail for like $1,000 with my $250 suit. I feel like that'd just give away that you're buying used. And while some enlightened people will think that's pretty clever, the kind of people who can identify thousand-dollar shoes on sight, I worry, are more likely to instead think you're just a pretender, which is not something I want to risk flashing in a professional setting.

 

[–]DissolutionedChemist 1 point 1 year ago 

Good is relative.

 

[–]FirstChurchOfBrutus 1 point 1 year ago 

A/E fan here, but I would have to recommend the classic lines only. The Strandmoks look cool, but boy, they do not hold up as well as the fully lined classics.

 

[–]UniqueBeyond9831 1 point 1 year ago* 

I drive by the Allen Edmonds factory store a few times a month and stop in from time to time for factory seconds. I’ve never found a blemish that required them to be seconds. Prices are good though!

It seems they’ve tried to get more casual over the last five or so years and some of those styles and quality seem off. The formal stuff is nice still, but I find myself wearing my formal shoes very infrequently since the office environment blew up in 2020.

[–]ISayAboot 4 points 1 year ago 

What are the shoes you're talking about?



[–]FullAutoLuxuryCommie 30 points 1 year ago 

Allen edmonds, cuccinelli, rancourt, morjas, grant stone. Probably more, but I grabbed those from my recent ebay searches lol



[–]nicholasgnames 1 point 1 year ago 

Lol cuccinelli. Thats the name stan fantasizes about having in an american dad episode lol.

 

[–]ISayAboot -3 points 1 year ago 

Are you talking used? I thought you meant a specific shoe

 

[–]KillYourFace5000 2 points 1 year ago 

FALC up there is on point with that list - I'm not talking about any one specific shoe. And yeah, I'd only look at the used ones. For my taste, if you're not paying full retail price or close to it on eBay for something "new," there's just too much of a chance it's not actually new, it's counterfeit, or it fell off the back of a truck. Not that they all necessarily fall into one of those categories, but I don't think it's worth it to maybe save some money when you can buy new elsewhere or save a lot of money buying even lightly used.

 

[–]Turdulator 1 point 1 year ago 

Theres 3 pieces of clothing I’d never buy used - shoes, socks, and underwear…. Gross

 

[–][deleted] 1 point 1 year ago 

Most of the people I work with wear actual sneakers to the office. The trick is to clean them, and eventually replace them before they become unsightly. I had a few casual dress shoes from working in the office for years, but COVID changed the required attire almost overnight. Eventually one of my old employers said that jeans and a polo shirt were perfectly fine. I didn’t think sneakers were acceptable in my current workplace until I saw a few people with outrageous designs. I still won’t do anything zany, but I have some nice shoes that work in most situations I’m in.

 

[–]TroyMacClure 1 point 1 year ago 

Buying someone's used Allen Edmonds with a cork footbed molded to someone else's foot isn't horribly uncomfortable?

Nordstrom Rack has incredible shoes for very affordable prices. It always amazes me.

 

[–]Telewacked 1 point 1 year ago 

I’m in a similar situation with my fashion choices. I fell in love with the dress shoes with the white soles (so comfortable!) but am finding they may not be the best choice. Would you mind showing an example of the shoes you’re recommending to OP?

 

[–]Yangervis 4 points 1 year ago 

OP needs a pair of Allen Edmonds Leeds or similar

 

[–]KillYourFace5000 6 points 1 year ago 

Not sure how well this link will work for you, but this is basically just an eBay search of brands that are popular, held in high esteem here, or otherwise have a good value proposition on eBay.

(Allen, Edmonds,, Church's,, Cuccinelli,, Rancourt,, Morjas,, Grant, Stone) in Men's Shoes | eBay

Honestly, you can do this with suits, jackets, shirts, ties, cufflinks, and even pants (though for some reason pants are the biggest PITA to find). You can get custom eBay search strings on this sub for eBay budget shopping all around. I don't know my brands well and, I'm sure, never really will, so those have been very helpful for me. I have had success with the lists I've been able to find, and eventually you start learning the basics: what patterns you like, what materials and features you like or tip that the piece is a good buy, that kind of stuff.

Once you filter down by size, style, condition, price, shipping, etc., even a really broad search is something you'll want to save and maybe get email notifications for. There'll be a ton of options, many of them will be great options, and every now and then, you'll spot one that's totally perfect for you specifically. Except maybe when it comes to pants. I might be doing something wrong on the pants front.

 

[–]Acct_For_Sale 1 point 1 year ago 

Like which ones? And how do you know your size for them? Sneaker size?

 

[–]FullAutoLuxuryCommie 1 point 1 year ago* 

Usually a size or half size down. Allen edmonds, cuccinelli, rancourt, morjas, grant stone

 

[–]KillYourFace5000 1 point 1 year ago 

I just bought a couple of pairs of Allen Edmonds Park Avenues, and they were exactly my sneaker size - 11, standard width (D). I just measured my foot with a tape measure the way a lot of shoemakers' websites describe.

 

[–]velocazachtor 10 points 1 year ago 

Just get comfortable dressy shoes. 



[–]RIP_Soulja_Slim 1 point 1 year ago* 

I do think sneakers and a jacket can work quite well in a casual setting. If op goes with a solid color polo, tucks it in, and does something like a pair of minimalist sneakers (I love my common projects, but just something along that vein for less is fine) and you've got a great business casual getup. I wear something similar quite a bit.

 

[–]RilkeanHearth 5 points 1 year ago 

I think a slip on like driving moccasins could work.. leather or suede can work. The sneakers feel a little too casual imo for meeting clients



[–]SeekerOfSerenity 2 points 1 year ago 

Don't listen to these fools. Keep the shoes. They keep the whole outfit a little casual. 



[–]Smooth-Awareness1736[S] 1 point 1 year ago

[–]Altruistic-Bobcat955 2 points 1 year ago

[–]the_lamou 5 points 1 year ago 

This comment brought to you by 2009! 2009: the flavor that won't go away!



[–]Altruistic-Bobcat955 0 points 1 year ago 

The entire point of a blazer is that it’s able to be dressed up for a formal event or down for casual wear. Being able to team it with jeans and sneakers or chinos and oxfords. Also fashion is cyclical. Here’s your guide as of 2024

Fashion trends by era are usually a case of the cut of clothes not the combination. Jeans and a jumper as of 2009 for a woman would be skinny jeans and an oversized jumper, 2024 would be flares with a cropped jumper, you see?

 

[–]the_lamou 1 point 1 year ago 

I don't know what "Men's Flair" is, but you shouldn't take your fashion advice from a "publication" with 151 Insta followers. That "guide" is terrible.

Everything else you wrote is wrong, too, but I just think it's hilarious that you're linking to a "magazine" that has less followers than I do, and I know all my followers personally.

 

[–]Altruistic-Bobcat955 1 point 1 year ago* 

Where would you turn for fashion advice? I picked a random guide to help, I didn’t realise it needed “pedigree” how about a Vogue article, GQ, Esquire or the fact Hermès included that look in their Spring 23 collection?

 

[–]the_lamou 0 points 1 year ago 

From your Vogue article:

People are definitely going to wear more shoes and less sneakers as well, it’s time for leather soles.

And also:

And shoes, not sneakers.

So not sure why you bothered including it.

The GQ article does suggest it, in one out of four looks, but Jesus is that a bad outfit suggestion. GQ died when Glenn O'Brien did.

Esquire is... Well, it's not quite as bad as GQ, but you really really shouldn't be looking to either of them for style advice. They're like Maxim for dudes that got an MBA from a third-tier school. Or at please pretend they did.

Where would I look for advice? On a blazer? Derek Guy is basically the definitive source for anything to do with men's tailoring. Start there.

 

[–]Altruistic-Bobcat955 2 points 1 year ago* 

So I should trust only what a Canadian fashion commentator (who only hit fame due to Twitters algorithm breaking after Musk screwed it up) says and ignore that Hermès featured blazer and sneakers in their collection as they are clearly wrong? The vogue article also featured a shot of the Zegna 2023 Milan show which had sneakers and blazers..

ETA: My partner follows permanent style religiously, it’s his doctrine. To the point he had to have their Private White collab coat. I would prefer that over Derek Guy.

 

[–]the_lamou 1 point 1 year ago 

Where did you get Canadian?

 

[–]Altruistic-Bobcat955 1 point 1 year ago* 

He was born in Vancouver. Interview about the Twitter debacle that led to a huge follower boom

Seems Derek isn’t against it:

“then combine everything with mid- or dark brown leather shoes. do a semi-casual style, such as chukkas, penny loafers, or derbies. IMO, oxfords don't look right in outfits that aren't suits. sneakers are possible, but again, they often require a bit of know-how, and it's just easier to do brown leather shoes”

 

[–]sbaggers 1 point 1 year ago 

Get a brush that hooks up to a drill, use a shoe specific soap or strong dish soap with the drill brush and they'll look brand new in minutes

 

[–]kleenkong 1 point 1 year ago 

On a casual day, sneakers can be fine. They need to be as pristine as possible. Washing will never make the cut though.

Buy more fashionable casual shoes as those are 10+ years out of style. Expect to buy replacements at least yearly.

 

[–]WillowMutual 1 point 1 year ago 

Stop wearing sneakers to your sales job. Also your pants are a bit too slim.

 

[–]Reddit-adm 1 point 1 year ago 

30 seconds with a baby wipe should do it.

 

[–]ummmm--no 1 point 1 year ago 

It isn't (only) that they are dirty but that the style is super casual. Maybe with the polo but itself but they are not good with the jacket. The pattern polo with clashing pattern jacket is a hard no.

 

[–]Mrknowitall666 1 point 1 year ago 

Jesus keyrist. Buy some shoes, not sneakers. Even loafers would work with a sport coat.

 

[–]az987654 1 point 1 year ago 

By wash you mean retired and replaced, right?

 

[–][deleted] 1 point 1 year ago 

If you’re wearing anything over a shirt, like a sport coat, please wear solid color shirts only.

 

[–]BusinessBear53 1 point 1 year ago 

Baby wipes when you get home if your shoes got a bit dirty or scuffed. Helps keep them tidy and looking fresh for longer so they don't need a big wash as frequently.

 

[–]Jaceman2002 1 point 1 year ago 

Some nice loafers would help balance the look if you want to keep the shirt and jacket combo.

I snagged a BNIB pair of Alden Cordovan loafers for $300 a few years back. Love ‘em and they work well with most colors. Easy to shine and maintain too.

 

[–]smileyke 1 point 1 year ago 

Cole Hahn has some really comfy oxfords that are almost sneaker-like. These https://www.colehaan.com/mens-2.zerogrand-laser-wingtip-oxfords/C25351.html or the Grand Laser ones if they need to be a bit fancier.

 

[–]BeardBootsBullets 1 point 1 year ago 

Sneakers could use a wash.

Sneakers have no place in sales, in 2024. You need to wear leather dress boots or leather shoes with a real welt.

Alden, J.Fitzpatrick, Lucchese, or Viberg.

 

[–]MyNameIsJakeBerenson 1 point 1 year ago 

I hate laces out, and his are real long too

I did a year of JROTC in 9th grade and part of the uniform regs was tucking in laces. I liked that aspect, and have been tucking laces on anything ever since. Probably a personal preference. But that there looks a little goofy to me

 

[–]UnusualPrince12 1 point 1 year ago 

Clorox wipe on those rubber soles works like a charm. All my vans stay looking clean that way. It won't make them shiny like new either, which I think is a positive. Just cleans up that white outsole.

But yeah wife is right, patterns are clashing. Each item on its own, with a solid polo or jacket, will look good. I really like the style of that blazer. Just not a fan of the clashing patterns

 

[–]goldensnow24 37 points 1 year ago 

Or just wear an OCBD!



[–]OnlyIfYouReReasonabl 36 points 1 year ago 

Traditional wisdom suggests avoiding stripes and checks combinations. In this case, tradition is right



[–]tennesseean_87 1 point 1 year ago 

Especially if the scale is so similar. You can do that jacket with tiny pinstripes like on an OCBD.

 

[–]snoots[🍰] 72 points 1 year ago 

Also, a polo with a jacket is just wrong unless you’re a frat boy in the 80s or 90s.

I have a casual/unstructured linen jacket from Sid Mashburn that looks good with a polo, but I wouldn't wear a conventional navy blazer with one.

[–]O11899988I999119725E 12 points 1 year ago 

Shoes should match belt and belt should either match pants or compliment jacket. Id go with brown or blue shoes and a solid shirt color (that also compliments the jacket) so either white, tan, or maybe yellow.

Also just pick one pattern and a solid color. There’s too many conflicting patterns here.



[–]avb1986 3 points 1 year ago 

Or a proper shirt, also less warm than a polo. And socks please, or is this OK in the US?

[–]Bucktown312 1 point 1 year ago 

No white soled leather upper “dress” shoes. They’re a sin. Jam on some loafers with no socks and solid polo if you must. Maybe a more neutral linen blazer…

 

[–]blatherskyte69 1 point 1 year ago 

Don’t combine stripes with checks/plaid. I learned that decades ago, and it almost always is the right choice.

 

[–]funkiemarky 1 point 1 year ago 

This. Patterns on patterns do not work. A plain t-shirt would be nicer but I agree with the polo. Get yourself some comfortable "dress shoes"(don't have to be fancy) and the outfit goes from meh to great. I'm also in sales so remember; "presentation dictates results" and how you dress is how you present yourself way before any interaction is made.

Second problem is a polo with a jacket. If you’re going for the formal casual look, just wear a T-shirt with the coat, but tuck it in and wear a belt.

 

[–]mnistor1 1 point 1 year ago 

Either solid jacket and pattern shirt or vice versa, unless you’re an elite fashion pro, I wouldn’t attempt to mix and match patterns/colors.

It’s not just that there’s two patterns, they specifically clash because they’re roughly the same scale.

Shoes arent that big of a problem imo, its that they're dirty - they'd look fine otherwise.

There's a lot wrong here. The jacket is actuallu the worst part bc of the clash in formality IMO. Looks like an orphaned suit jacket.

If he lost the jacket, it would be the easiest fix, but I'd guess he needs to be wearing a jacket of some sort for a conference or a customer visit. If you need business casual, find a solid polo or button down (Oxford weave) and a navy blazer. Replace the beat up sneakers with a pair of loafers and you'll be set.

This is the answer. Solid color polo and good to go

 

[–]SemperVeritate 1 point 1 year ago 

The main problem is that the outfit looks juvenile and inappropriate for 50yo man, especially the polo and shoes. The pants and blazer are workable.

 

[–]doscia 1 point 1 year ago 

I would also say that those pants are incredibly outdated too

I would say one reason is because of the contrasting patterns on the polo shirt and the blazer. if the blazer has a pattern than the inner shirt should not. or vice versa.

thats just me though.

Combining patterns can absolutely be done. But it's an art, and if you aren't sure you know why the two patterns you picked worked together, it's best to assume that they don't. Often patterns are too similar in size, as is the case here where the spacing of the stripes on the shirt nearly exactly matches the spacing of the blocks of plaid on the jacket.



[–]Captraptor01 65 points 1 year ago 

the correct take.



[–]GloryGoal 29 points 1 year ago 

Would you be able to provide examples of combined patterns working? I’m very curious to see how it could be done but don’t have a great eye for it.



[–]Artistdramatica3 103 points 1 year ago 

One rule is if one pattern is big, the other should be small



[–]StopLookListenNow 48 points 1 year ago 

Yes. It also helps to have different types of patterns: stripes, dots, paisley, plaid, and others.



[–]TentCityVIP 21 points 1 year ago 

Camo and plaid combo

Generally the patterns should get larger the further from your body. So, a shirt with small vertical stripes can go with a jacket that has a large window pane pattern.

Edit: Shirt not shit lol.



[–]benskarrd 27 points 1 year ago 

So I tried throwing a shit with small vertical stripes to a guy wearing a jacket that has large window pane pattern but he just got mad. :(



[–]jcned 16 points 1 year ago 

Understandable, I can’t imagine most people enjoy poop being flung at them.

The books you want for this are Dressing the Man by Alan Flusser and Gentleman by Berhard

Read Dressing the man by Alan Flusser, he has a chapter on patterns, but you'll love the whole book



[–]dccorona 3 points 1 year ago 

I think the better thing to do is just look through the work of designers known for doing it well. Ralph Lauren (especially Purple Label - I do find sometimes they overdo it in Polo but you can find good examples there too) is one of the best.



[–]panphilla 3 points 1 year ago 

I commented elsewhere, but here is an article with some advice for getting started with mixing patterns.



[–]charismatictictic 4 points 1 year ago 

It also tends to look good if one of the colors in both patterns is the same. Like, if you have a shirt with black, white and blue, one of those colors should also be in the jacket.

Glad somebody said this. Some people absolutely have the ability to make combined patterns work.



[–]RIP_Soulja_Slim 3 points 1 year ago 

This is true, but if you're remotely in doubt it's far better to pair solids with patterns. Personally I don't own any patterned shirts for this reason.

[–]quartzion_55 41 points 1 year ago 

Especially when it’s such a casual shirt. You can make clashing patterns work and look good but you almost have to go either super casual or super dressy, but this is just kind of in the no man’s land style-wise and looks sloppy and ill thought out



[–]I_snort_crayons 24 points 1 year ago 

Agree with this



[–]dick_for_hire 7 points 1 year ago 

Personal taste and all, but in addition to the patterns I also just hate the color combo.

[–]TheDefiantOne19 4 points 1 year ago 

This.

Otherwise, solid color combo, and choice in attire

Just the patterns clash



[–]nerdymutt 2 points 1 year ago 

True! Old rule that a lot of people break, but can’t pull off. I hate the jacket because, he looks like he’s going to ride the bus to Appleby’s with an Olive Garden jacket on? You are either sporty or dressed up, don’t try to do both.



[–]comFive 4 points 1 year ago 

Yeah too many patterns on the shirt.



[–]RococoHobo 28 points 1 year ago 

It's called power-clashing and he does it because he can.

For sales, this is terrible, especially those vans

Over-casual

Not just you

 

[–]burner1312[🍰] 1 point 1 year ago 

Came here to say this but you captured it perfectly

 

[–]cnapp 1 point 1 year ago 

Yeah, this is a basic rule. Don't mix patterns.

There is nothing wrong with the shirt or the blazer. They both just need to be paired separate with a solid colored garment

 

[–]thegeorgianwelshman 1 point 1 year ago 

This right here.

 

[–]Vio_ 1 point 1 year ago 

Shirt screams second grade school picture, jacket screams sales team for mid-regional office supplies.

 

[–]starkel91 1 point 1 year ago 

Twenty years ago I saw the movie 25th Hour. I don’t remember anything about the plot, all I remember is Barry Pepper’s character saying “ladies ever tell you that you look like a fucking optical illusion?”

That’s what I think of every time someone wears contrasting patterns.

 

[–]myychair 1 point 1 year ago 

Yup outside of that it’s fine imo, just wipe the shoes clean a little bit

 

[–]FirstChurchOfBrutus 1 point 1 year ago 

You can work multiple patterns, but it’s always a risk. If it works, it really works, but far easier to miss.

This isn’t a horrendous clash, but it’s definitely off.

Wife wins.

[–]Seeker80 59 points 1 year ago* 

Not even a close thing. Double Flawless Victory for the wife.

Go pick up a navy jacket, some brown Cole Haan loafers, and then take the wife out for dinner as an apology.

I'm in sales support, rarely ever see a customer, and am better dressed than than this. Like, c'mon.



[–]weighingthedog 88 points 1 year ago 

Sad thing is OP will never inform her of her victory. 😆

She always is.
