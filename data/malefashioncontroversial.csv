With humility and understanding.\n\nSome of your outfits just work, they’re conventionally matched, the style and cut matches you and your build. Some of your outfits aren’t anything close to conventional, and I think that’s fine. I don’t think conventional was ever your goal, so when people find it abrasive you’re receptive and open to the criticism. \n\nI always try and be constructive when I’m on this sub because it seems disingenuous to comment in this sub without having SOMETHING to add relating to the actual fashion \n\nI don’t know a damn thing about fashion but I’d think a lot more people would be open to this outfit if the top and the kilt/skirt meshed together better. Maybe by unifying the color. You clearly don’t care about gender norms or expectations, so you might be able to find ONE article of clothing to do both jobs. Rompers and overalls can be a good gender neutral example of that. As for the boots, I’d honestly say they’re just too ornate, and something simpler would mesh better with the rest; in the same vein, you honestly have too many details/accessories. For some reason the arms seem to be a place that benefits from asymmetry rather than symmetry. The watch and bracelet serve the same purpose as far as visual weight goes. I’d either lose one or maybe double up on bracelets to atleast break the look up. \n\nCurrently it looks like you’re wearing three different styles of clothing and it might help if you unified them or maybe just settled on one ( two if you really want to focus on a clashing of styles, to me three just looks unplanned ). Cowboy boots with ornate designs can work, but usually when you see that there’s something else in the outfit to back it up. You can either tame the boots to get then to work with a simpler outfit, or wear something that makes the boots look more like a purposeful statement than just... loud shoes. \n\nThat’s all I’ve got for ideas though.', 'score': 5, 'created_utc': '2019-11-01 11:37:24'}, {'author': 'Raidicus', 'body': '>Most “regular” clothes don’t look good on me either.\n\nI really sense the way you are grappling with a desire to simply wear what you like, and to be happy and comfortable in what you\'re wearing.\n\nConceptually I think what\'s fascinating about your outfits is that you\'re using off-the-shelf retail brands to express what are very avante garde ideas.  Silhouettes, gender-bending, color choices...they\'re all very decidedly anti-fashion. I think if that was your *intent* it would be an interesting commentary on the avante garde\'s accessibility to ""middle America"" as well as truer to anti-fashion than much of what I see on this sub-reddit in that most people are basically buying expensive brands that claim to be anti-fashion but are in reality quite established and well-known brands.\n\nThe fact that you photograph yourself in what appears to be a Courtyard Marriott while dressed in this manner is also an interesting commentary on masculinity....seeming to allude to the secret lives of businessmen who use these types of hotels as private places to explore their own secret lives whether that be through sexuality, crossdressing, or even just as an escape from their mundane family lives.\n\nI don\'t know if you intend any of these conceptual ideas to read through in what you\'re presenting, but that\'s simply how I interpret what you create.\n\nSo I\'ve said it before, I\'ll say it again: you\'re a very interesting guy and I\'m glad you post here.

So much of online fashion talk is just ""how can I do things right?"" ""How can I Impress people?"".

Genuine self expression and experimentation is often incoherent. It\'s often aesthetically displeasing.

Is it giving modern Jefferson?	"First of all, yes it's supposed to fit like that (size small)

Second, no I did not walk around all day with my hands hidden. 

I am wearing my anniversary gift that my gf bought me - a haider ackermann raw silk ruffled shirt. Big Thomas Jefferson vibes and I'm here for it. I am also wearing a vintage gold cross necklace to fit with the vintage vibe. Not pictured is the ridiculous jewelry and rings I paired with the fit - a few chunky asymmetric pearl, diamond, and gold rings. 

Towards the recent end of his runways and standalone releases (2019ish), Haider Ackermann created gorgeous and detailed oversized silk shirts with what I can only describe as mega cuffs. I don't own any other shirt where I can make it short sleeved - while cuffed - just by pulling the sleeve up. It can fit around my elbow lol. 

The detailing on this shirt is perhaps the most intricate and tailored compared to any other shirt I've ever seen, maybe on par or ahead of some of my hand embroidered Bode shirts. 

EVERY single edge of the shirt has raw hems which are prone to dangling threads but It's OK - quick snip and we are back in action. 

The 2nd pic shows my favorite perspective, the elongated arms make the shirt look more like wearable sculpture. When I put the shirt on, it feels like I am a walking exhibit for Haider's art. 

I played with the proportions even more by partially tucking in the shirt to high waisted Saint Laurent pants that billow at the hip and taper sharply by the hem. These are my go-to pants for dressier looks. I asked the tailor to let the pants sit with a bit of a stack above the shoe, which matches well with the ruffles and stacks on the sleeve when I actually do put my hands through it. 

I post more crazy fits on my personal insta: @offlinegarrett

Thoughts? What would you change?

wiwt: forest druid		66	http://i.imgur.com/tp2oU65.jpg	None	2013-12-28 20:19:50	http://i.imgur.com/tp2oU65.jpg	"[{'author': 'Syeknom', 'body': ""Wow, this thread's comments are really appallingly low quality and unpleasant in spirit even for the norm here.\n\n**yung_trunks_get_em** I like what you're trying to channel here and that sense of fun and exploration is only to be strongly encouraged. The cardigan piece is really neat but the outfit as a whole doesn't exactly work as others have noted - the trousers and especially the creepers are doing it no favours (I think creepers are incredibly strongly urban in their design).\n\nFeel like you could get a lot of inspiration for this from the [classic Raf Simons AW 2002-2003 show titled **Virginia Creeper [*Parthenocissus Quinquefolia*]**](http://supertalk.superfuture.com/index.php/topic/63169-raf-simons-fw-0203/).\n\n[Synopsis](http://www.contemporaryfashion.net/index.php/none/more/1055/uk/work.html):\n\n> **The Theme:**\n\n> The starting point of this collection is the duality of nature. Both soothing and cruel, nature is still not totally conquered by mankind. At the same time the forceful beauty of nature continues to be a fascination, for previous as much as today's generation. Even after centuries of industrial progress, these elements of nature maintain their intrigue, mystery and wonder about them.\n\n> Owls for instance are not just birds; their silence and withdrawal is almost inexplicable as is simultaneously alluring. \n\n> Vast and impenetrable woods still put fear into mere mortals. Uncharted swamps serve no real purpose but remain the staple of ominous tales and whispered stories. > > Poisonous weeds (like the Canadian Virginia Creeper of the collection's title) are a wonderful sight to the eye of the beholder while at the same time cannot be touched or eaten. All said subjects, predators, plants and caprices of nature alike, are isolated, almost separated from modern civilisation.\n\n> They compose both themes and background of our darker fantasies. It is not surprising, that they keep cropping up in horror movies (e.g. The Blair Witch Project, The > Swamp Thing) as well as thriller books. No wonder their splendid, self-contained isolation alludes to a higher, and more pure state of mind.\n\n> **The Collection:**\n\n> The colours used in the collection are all derived from nature-related themes: forest browns and nightly blacks, slate greys, leafy greens and snowy off-whites. Just like owl feathers or the shades over swamps keep blending into each other, the silhouettes also have changing hues and colour tones, similar to the notion of camouflage.\n\n> Coats are heavy and loose - almost dripping off the body\n.\n> Sleeveless padded jackets, hooded, parka-like coats and adventure-style jacquard sweaters are worn on top of each other, to create a 'explorer-of-nature' feel. Certain shapes are tricks of the eye: a 'double' coat, looking like a bomber jacket worn over a long coat, is in fact cut in one piece.\n\n> Also referring to the swamp scenery is a surprising bondage theme. Surprising as the bondage look is not used to restrict or confine the body. Instead, thick harnesses of ribbons are 'draped' over voluminous coats and baggy trousers similar to an imaginary safety net.\n\n> In contrast to this tribute to nature, there's a fiercely technological side to the collection. Just like nature is brutalised by the intrusion of man, the clothes are equally embroiled in a battle where throwaway plastic - commonly used to produce garbage bags, is thrown into the equation as much as 'anti-nature' materials such as nylon, fake leather, rubber, industrial gauzes, waxed cotton and varieties of plastic, for trousers, ponchos and capes. The metallic shine and hard colour palette (silver, electric blue) of these fabrics, used along quality natural wool and tweeds, create an unusual but intriguing friction.\n\n> To complete the story, U.S. collegiate teenage fashion (baseball blousons, sport sweaters) also permeates through the collection. \n\nIt's coming at the subject from a different approach (the modern/technological/brutalisation aspect with the aggressively synthetic materials) but observe how form, layers and colours are used to create a cohesive narrative. Raf was a furniture designer before doing fashion and studied industrial design - here he demonstrates a remarkable skill with shape and structure to say what he wants to with the collection.\n\nYou could find a lot to draw on it from it perhaps - your fit is something of a round peg in a square hole and I think you need to come at it again from a different angle and with a different eye. *Virginia Creeper* may offer some interesting perspective to that effect."", 'score': 57, 'created_utc': '2013-12-29 01:05:32'}, {'author': 'None', 'body': 'no there isnt\n\nwhat is or isnt ""male fashion"" isnt decided by some hick in kentucky that sits at home playing battlefield all day sorry', 'score': 52, 'created_utc': '2013-12-28 23:45:08'}, {'author': 'havensk', 'body': 'SHIRExBAGGINS', 'score': 48, 'created_utc': '2013-12-28 21:21:09'}, {'author': 'None', 'body': 'im glad i dont live in bumfuck alabama then', 'score': 44, 'created_utc': '2013-12-28 23:19:25'}, {'author': 'None', 'body': '[removed]', 'score': 36, 'created_utc': '2013-12-28 20:27:38'}, {'author': 'None', 'body': 'bible belt is bible belt', 'score': 36, 'created_utc': '2013-12-28 23:42:39'}, {'author': 'tuffbot324', 'body': 'welcome to /r/malefashion', 'score': 33, 'created_utc': '2013-12-28 23:20:56'}, {'author': 'None', 'body': 'people on the internet ridicule everything', 'score': 33, 'created_utc': '2013-12-29 00:23:23'}, {'author': 'None', 'body': 'why do u care\n\njust look at the fit instead of trying to internet detective my life to see whether im ""allowed"" to wear certain designers', 'score': 24, 'created_utc': '2013-12-28 21:31:42'}, {'author': 'Shaninja', 'body': 'Bottom half is to clean and slim compared to top half.

How to make myself look more feminine?	"Hi everyone, I am a born-male who identifies as female, or at least very close to it on the gender spectrum. Due to financial and social/familial reasons I really cannot afford to transition, and dressing very femine is the closest I can really get. I'm not comfortable in a lot of stereotypical women's clothes like skirts/dresses because of personal and social anxiety, so I'm simply looking for ways to make myself look more like a girl in unisex-style clothes. [Here](http://m.imgur.com/a/TM5Xz) is an album that shows how i look/dress. I'm pretty thin (112 lbs.) and normal height (5'8""). I realize this might be an atypical question, but I think this is the best place to ask because of the more experimental clothing styles and openness of this sub compared to MFA.

The rest of this post pretty much is based on the answer to that being Yes, but if it's not then I can offer some other thoughts too. (I guess an example of the distinction I'm thinking is that I've seen a few FTM or non-op female-bodied queer people post on MFA, and I'd give different advice if they wanted to dress to look more male-bodied at work than if they wanted to look more male-bodied or masculine in queer communities.)\n\nAs people have said, stuff like AnnD can be good for inspiration. I'd also recommend some Japanese brands, like Attachment, Viridi-Anne, and Julius. I feel like Japanese style in general is more androgynous, and you have a body type that could work well with it. Specific things to look for are cap sleeves and scoop necks. Drape necks, boat necks, and non-male-traditional cardigans (thinking of wrapped ones, or with a button near the shoulder) are some othes. Tank tops too. I'm on mobile and won't be able to give links for a few days if you want examples, but if you do, reply and I'll definitely get back to you before the week's over. \n\nFor shoes, I'd tend toward low-tops, slip-ons, maybe derbies. Sandals too I suppose, although I could conceive of a person's feet being too masculine.\n\nBottoms is probably what you're already thinking: skinny jeans, cropped pants. I've noticed many women's slacks to be of different fabric, so something like wool may be better than chinos. Take them to a tailor for tapering, hemming, and perhaps pulling in fabric and the butt seam (I'm sure there's a better word).\n\nIf you're into the gothier stuff, check out r/fringefashion too.

Alternatively, loose and flowy pants can often cut down the masculinity in an outfit.  \n\nSince its summer I've been a big fan of low neck, elongated sleeveless tops on wavy loose cropped pants.  Shoes that slim down your feet are nice too (sandals, sock-style boots, low profile sneakers).  \n\nAvoid bulking up your top half, I have pretty broad shoulders but also a wide waist so I try to accentuate my waist over my shoulders.  \n\nHope this helps!

Here is my response:\n\nSunglasses: These are spectacles. Nevertheless I'll imagine your rules still apply. The trouble is there really are no rules when it comes to fashion. Trends, maybe - but if fashion was ruled based it wouldn't be much fun. These spectacles are based on a 1930's shape worn by a wide variety of faces. \n\nCoat: The coat is a modified mountain parka, again a vintage sillouette. Originally it didn't have a zip but someone in the 40's cut it in half and made themselves a coat. You're right that it isn't a peacoat or a parka - it's  not really anything from any category. There are lots of different coats in the world although I understand peacoats and parkas might be what you're comfortable with.\n\nThe vest: Not sure what you mean but I think it's the T. It's a breton boat neck jersey.\n\nStriped shirt: I think you meant 'lo and behold' and it's a noragi. Unless you mean the T in which case refer back to the previous point. \n\nThe pants: These trousers are workmen trousers from what I think might be the 50's. They're a vintage fit and actually fit on the waist with no belt. The patches are there because the knees wore away.\n\nShoes: I really like these nursing home comments but these are actually taken from a vintage skate shoe pattern. Might be a bit much for you I understand and I apologise.\n\nLook, mate. This was all kind of constructive but your overall tone sucks. Not everyone has to look the same or follow any set of weird rules. You're being insulting - and it's so uncalled for but you'd really do well to be more open minded. \n\nNot for me. I don't care.

I mean, it's not hard to be influenced by what you see on product pages. However, I don't browse SSENSE often. I used to really like Totokaelo's styling, but they've really gone downhill recently in that respect, IMO. (Not sure if anyone else feels the same way, btw.) I don't really browse other fashion forums. No one here is posting fits with SLP or Prorsum that I've seen recently. The SLP page on SF just feels incestuous and anyone who wears SLP gets high praise no matter how terrible the rest of the fit looks. It doesn't seem like a good place to grow. In terms of other stuff I'm interested in (like Geller and Ann D) there's SZ, but that place is such a shit-show that it's impossible for me to embrace. What I'm left with are fits posted here and runway shows on Now Fashion. Are there other places I should look? If there are please let me know. \n\n> most exciting and expensive way to be completely inoffensive\n\nRight now, I'm cool with that. It's not really my style to be offensive. I like looking relatively clean, crisp, and unoffensive. \n\n> here, in the context of people interested in male fashion\n\nThat's a really good point. I think it's important for me to say that I don't think I'm doing anything earth shattering with my fits. I enjoy sharing when certain pieces come together really well regardless of being super unique, and then seeing how others agree/disagree. It's not just sharing for the sake of sharing, it's also for learning/growing/staying current. I enjoy male fashion as much as anyone here so this is just my contribution and attempt to stay active.

(Constructive) Thoughts on this fit?		17	https://i.redd.it/qczka7b9haf51.jpg	aboyandhisjadons	2020-08-06 01:58:43	https://i.redd.it/qczka7b9haf51.jpg	"[{'author': 'devastationz', 'body': ""Everything looks a size too small and the quality of the fabric looks cheap. It's not presenting any new ideas which is fine but, the ideas that it does present isn't particularly interesting. Like something you see on the Instagram explore page or on an ASOS influencer. It's just really basic and the only thing that's setting it apart is the top being cropped but, unlike something like one of /u/kaijerl's older fits. [This is similar](https://i.redd.it/knyl6s94chw41.png) but, taken to another level.  What sets their fit apart from yours is that the pieces that they use are just more ~~expensive~~ unique to the ones that you use. The waxed pants merge well with the shine of their heels so much so that I had to actively look for the break in between pants and boot. The low rise of the pants allows their stomach and skintone to provide contrast between the materials and the colors.  Their top provides a break in super shiny materials into a deep dull matte that really compliments the shine of their bottoms. With yours the choice of materials are just so  normal. They're normal black jeans and a normal top. I never really checkered print so I'm bias but, it is very teen 'cool guy/girl'. Instead of a proper crop on the top it just looks like you sized down a few times due to the way it comes up on your arms.  The pants you've seen a thousand times, so by pairing them with that top it just makes the fit really average in my eyes with a few cool elements. I also am just bias against platform Docs but, that's mostly cause I'm a manlet with big feet so, I'd look weird in them. I think your wardrobe would benefit from more out there clothing. Seeing this fit with some of[ Syro's boots especially their backlaces](https://shopsyro.com/shop/backlace) would be cool. Pants that compliment the luster of your boots or even loose flared pants with a slight luster to them to sit over the boots would compliment it more.

The top half is only a bit better. The longer shirt has shreds that are just too long in the wrong places, having that drop lower in the crotch is kind of off-putting, if it were off to the sides, even off-center it would make more sense to me.

I already know what you think of your own fits. \n\nI have numerous problems with almost everything else youve said here but this time i havent been asked to explain so i wont bother you with my gripes. If you dont want my thoughts and youre gonna act like this next time dont ask me to tell you what i think. \n\n', 'score': 18, 'created_utc': '2018-11-22 14:20:38'}, {'author': 'ThatCommanderShepard', 'body': ""Mostly the actual outfits. I like eqqys photos a lot but even as a fan i think sometimes they treat showing off the outfit as secondary to the concept so i dont really let that color my judgement of his fits (of which i am also a big fan).\n\nBefore i say anything of course i want to let you know i only assume this to be my opinion and not a fact nor something i expect you to agree with or heed in any serious way. I think you and eqqy are both unique individuals when it comes to forum fashion, but i think where eqqy comes at it fashion and execution first and ideas second i think you place the romantic idea of what you're wearing before the actual proper execution of your fit, at least this is what i have garnered from your comments and outfit descriptions.\n\nI think that if you really look at it no matter how wierd eqqys fits get his colors and proportions are always precise and well executed. For example compare [this fit of eqqys](https://i.imgur.com/vWeWwoX.jpg) to [this fit of yours ](https://i.imgur.com/svUL3uF.jpg). Both are a similar shape, and both utilize a lot of very expensive (msrp, everyone deal hunts so thats not factoring in) garments from brands that specialize in kinda wacky clothes. Eqqys color pallete of greens and greys is pretty consistently colored throughout and his shoes to a lot to balance out how fucking bonkers huge his top is as well as preventing the pants from swallowing the shoes and looking too dumpy (a looser fit swallowing shoes looks great imo but i think a more straight cut like these and yours dont always look great like that ). Your fit is very inconsistent in color, mixing drab greens with neon greens and navy with a sort of turquoise. The shirt as a whole doesnt jive color wise with anything else and as touched on before the shoes dont really interact very will with your pants at least in the context of the fit (it could look good with a whole different top outfit). The hoodie as well seems to be too slim in the sleeves and body to really match up with pants size as well but i cant be sure given the shirt covering it up. \n\nIf you compare these two huge pants fits [with eqqys here ](https://i.imgur.com/zWQkyWm.jpg) and [yours here ](https://i.imgur.com/wPgL1dk.jpg) we again see what makes ones execution more refined. Both of you seem to have colors and pant shoe interaction on lock with this one, but while eqqy balances his bottom with a layered and oversized top with a lot of flow, your fit is bottom heavy to the extreme with a flare at the hips tapering in to a very small top. It creates a very unflattering pear shape that i dont think anyone focusing on execution would really ever be okay with. \n\nIm no stranger to wacky fits and unique ideas in outfits and i really do admire your psyched out influences and the inspiration you clearly draw from your music taste, but it feels rough and unrefined. I see you with all these interesting and unique and pricy pieces from brands like kapital and sometimes i like the fit, but it always feels like the items are bought before you actually know how youre going to put them in a fit and rather purched them because they captured an aesthetic you admire and you just had to have it. \n\nTo focus on this fit i think theres a number of ways your influences both color it and make it more creative and kneecap it visually. Starting at the accessories i think that given the shape and colors in this fit, as well as the sloppy (not good or bad thing here) look of it pair poorly with the fingerless gloves and beanie, and as averse as i am to this critique i think it looks a bit..... homeless, or at the very least very tastelessly careless. I think moving down to the flannel, i like the idea of the super-huge flannel outer but i think the light fabric and crinkly shape make it look very very cheap when combined with its oversized look. I think the addition of the band tee as well does a lot to mess up the shape and colors of the fit. The shirt fits you properly, but given how huge your other items surrounding it are, it makes your torso seem kind of pinched and shrunken in comparison. I also feel like the colors (especially the reds and blues) mess up the color pallete of this fit, with their more triadic and bright look popping out in a kind of cheap way from the earthy and muted reds and blues on the entire rest of your fit. I actually really like the bottom half of your fit and i think the textures shapes and colors are wonderful, but i dont think 2/5 is a goal to strive for and think you have the potential and the vision to be better than this. \n\nI get (or at least i assume) that in a lot of ways you're pulling from the effortless/careless grunge and pych looks of artists you admire, but if thats the case it comes off as a but too manufactured and inauthentic to really give me the same feelings those artists do. I think you are unapologetically yourself, and i do really love to see that, but in my eyes i see a rough stone that needs some polish before it can really shine. \n\nFwiw i have liked every fit youve had with that windowpane blazer of yours. Not sure if that means anything. I hope i haven't been too unhelpful and i hope i havent been too rude.

But also don\'t obsess and try to create anything perfect, life isn\'t perfect and this isnt a subreddit for perfect content, its a subreddit for sharing fashion ideas and concepts. I think when you sorta approach the way you do you align yourself more with subreddits like MFA? \n\nIn response to the first eqqy outfit, theres one color going on there primarily, green. I would not say it\'s the best example considering the intent and concepts are completely different, save for oversized fitting and loose trousers, which  i dont think is enough to warrant side by side comparison. i cant say i ever think about outfit prices but also conceptually dumpy is basically just another way to say homeless, so cmon. they are thrifted cargos ive worn hundreds of times and repaired, that much is true. The yellow on the hood and the green graphic play off each other really well in my opinion, and i can assure you the hoodie [is not slim on me](https://i.imgur.com/NpzTaqn.jpg), no matter how much of a staggering broad gal i am. the shoes click really well with the overall vibe imo, as well as the yellow and orange detailing being really fun and playing off the general vibe of it, its a fantastic outfit to skate in.\n\nSecond outfit. Again two completely different concepts at play here. eqqy is wearing i believe [levis from silvertabs](http://www.workingclassheroes.co.uk/images/skatebaggy5pocketh4.jpg)? while my pants are a wholly different [fit and style](https://www.kapital-webshop.jp/client_info/KAPITAL/itemimage/K1809LP810/K1809LP810_1.jpg), being influenced by traditional  eastern work pants. also the photo i posted was incredibly unflattering, by choice, as i mentioned in that post actually. it just brings up the second idea i brought up, about the subreddit itself. \n\nkapital isnt really pricey, and i would say i just have a concise and focused wardrobe, this just comes off passive aggressive and weird.\n\nusing the ol\' homeless critique is pretty low lmao, i got nothing. it isnt a flannel actually! its a button down dress shirt, the material is very light and flowy! it isnt a band tee, its an visual artists (painting) and it actually fits rather large on me, the sleeves go down to my elbows. a pinched and shrunken torso isnt a bad visual cue!! i would have agreed with you if it werent so long but you just come off like you think you know more than you do. again, theres no focus on earthy tones, the brown toque has neon green repair work throughout and the shoes are fairly light / bright. as seen in the product photos, the pants are bright indigo blue as well. \n\ngrunge... that literally isnt a thing in my books. just call it alt / indie or hair metal. and i think you massively misconstrued my comments on my inspo.  I am inspired by the sounds, the spaces in between sounds the shapes of jazz ect, not like ... literally how artists dress? I personally find being inspired by other folks incredibly unappealing in my current stage of my life, and that second part comes off hella passive aggressive and pretty fuckin assumptious and dumb, especially given how much music, creating it, seeing it live, and listening to it, has been a huge part of my life.\n\nin short i think you really need to ditch your the mfa mindset, to sound like the stupid white girl i am ; fashion is a gorgeous orgy ov transcendence and decadence, not a hyper masculine porno fuck fest to see who cums further.

Even the way it was framed. Dude\'s definitely a dickhead - though I think its the outspokenness that sets him apart from a lot of these guys. In an industry that tolerates the views of Dolce & Gabanna / John Galiano - it seems rather meh. I take more issue with the fact his casting is entirely white - thus his vision for ""depressed rich kids"", takes on a uniquely self-pitying cringe factor. Growing up black in West LA I know the type well. \n\nOn the clothing front - that t-shirt is basically a direct combination of two Vivenne Westwood Seditionaries graphics - one with the two mice having sex - the other with Snow White + the 7 Dwarfs and a Swastika. That\'s not to excuse it or decontextualize the use of Swastikas as a tasteless way to shock people- but it is a direct homage to iconic punk graphics FWIW. \n\nThe cashmere noose seems like a gallows joke. Some depressed people do like to joke bout killing themselves - seems along that general line of thought. Don\'t really take issue with that - the price in itself is satirical. \n\nThe Columbine Sweater is a really bad look. I\'m old enough to remember it - and I feel like most other people who do wouldn\'t ever find it funny or edgy.

I can always appreciate someone figuring out their personal style and mode of expression. The biggest thing for me here is the formality clash.

Personally I don’t think the waistcoat as a base layer here works, but I think maybe it could in other circumstances. It’s all sharp lines and tweed though, which are difficult to divorce from its origins in this context. \n\nThe skirt is a little hard to see, but I like what’s going on there. The issue is that the silk doesn’t have the weight, fabric and visual, that the other pieces do, so it looks a little out of place to my eyes. Blazer and skirt is certainly a doable combo, but these don’t mesh here, and they’re really offset by the Docs, which are at the extreme other end of the formal-casual spectrum. Docs and bare legs is a bold look, and I don’t think it works here with everything else. It’s grungy from the knees down, and a little formal above, but in a mismatched manner. \n\nKeep at it though!

Why aren't there riding boots for men? Ever think we'll get them?	"Riding boots are those tall leather boots that are very popular among girls. They actually used to be a military boot (still are) used by men. You generally tuck your pants into them and they go up to your knee.

Did they update roshes? They look awful also, i've heard that Roshes aren't even that comfortable. But you're in Japan I think? It looks like you'll be doing alot of walking so, consider switching to a React technology sneaker. They generally look better and some of their models of cheap. If you want to go for more of athleisure type of look then I would suggest the [Epic React](https://www.nike.com/t/epic-react-flyknit-mens-running-shoe-ZwTJE04z/AQ0067-002) or Zoom React. If you want something abit more fashionable but harder to wear then the [React Element 87](https://www.goat.com/search?query=rEACT%20ELEMENT%2087) but, if you want a middle ground between the two then the[ React Element 55](https://www.nike.com/t/react-element-55-mens-shoe-KpnWKm/BQ6166-003) is good. The React Element 87 gives you more customization by being see-through so, you can wear some nice marl socks. I think that shoes can really make or break an outfit and the good thing with sneakers is that they can fit in with damn near every outfit. \n\nSomething else that you can do to really make a basic outfit really pop is just going with similar colors. Like a monochromatic theme but, don't let monochrome make you think that only use grayscale type colors. ~~Though men do typically gravitate towards those. They are safe and you can't go wrong with it.~~ Also going with similar colors can *really* make an outfit go from basic to something special. [I put this gallery I put together](https://imgur.com/a/2HRbBme) so, you can get an idea of what i'm trying to say. See how the colors are similar tints and shade and hues? Sometimes with a loud analogous color? I think that looks really good. It's really one of the easiest ways to get me to love your fit instantly.\n\nAnyway.\n\nI like denim but, your denim looks kinda cheap and flimsy. The wash is aight and so is the fit of the pants. I generally don't like cuffing but, it doesn't look awful right here. Next time, try some light wash gray pants. ~~I also like stacking from that 2015 era of fashion. I like stacks.~~\n\nRight now cropped wide flowing trousers are the in thing. So, even with those grey sneakers that you have on right now, you could get some nice grey trousers that and that would look good too. You're in Japan so, you can go to the god store Uniqlo and see if they have some stuff you like. \n\nYour shirt is long. It doesn't make you look short like long shirts do on me which good. But, it could be better. I can't tell if that's a design on the back or it's just a side stripe. \n\nIt's cold in Japan now right? A stream I was watching said it was cold as fuck.

All of fade that I worked hard for disappeared and was replaced by the color of the jean. Next I went through a pair of NF Left twill. Worn those for 2 weeks and realized how shitty the denim was. Bought a pair of APC NS afterwards, loved those for the first week of the breaking-in process. They then stretched like a mother fucker as expected, now I don't even want to bat an eye at that nasty shit. But I still wear it once in a while.

So MF, what's the one item that you're most sick of last year?"	7	https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashion/comments/16evwj/malefashion_whats_one_piece_of_clothing_that/	meyz	2013-01-12 01:16:23	['No images']	"[{'author': 'decalotus', 'body': ""Boat Shoes.

Lots of that had to do with the French Revolution. People wanted to distance themselves from the ostentatiousness of the monarchy, and the general distrust/dislike for Marie Antoinette led people to associate the rococo aesthetic and femininity with an incompetent ruling class. The republic sought to bring back classical Greek values, which is why silhouettes became more columnar (see women\'s empire-waist dresses from 1810s.) This is why we see [mens] clothing become much simpler to show allegiance with the sans-culottes/commoners and reflect the values of ""liberté, égalité, fraternité"".', 'score': 31, 'created_utc': '2019-02-26 05:02:19'}, {'author': 'egon07', 'body': 'Wow, she’s annoying.', 'score': 22, 'created_utc': '2019-02-25 20:53:19'}, {'author': 'Broken_chairs', 'body': 'Sorry, this one just ain\'t for me, IMO it\'s a mess.\n\nThe author takes a loose grasp on history and attempts to tie it to toxic masculinity via a weak argument that relies heavily on the trope of ""telling us how it is/handing us a red pill"" rather than on substance.\n\nYes, Brummell has had a strong influence on the direction that male fashion has taken through the last couple of centuries. Though, the shift to more ""mundane"" fashion wasn\'t soley orchestrated by one despicable man who was too poor to afford ""fancy jewellery and expensive fabrics"" (the dude inherited a fortune & was raised in elite society). He simply influenced a trend in fashion that aligned strongly with the societal and political mindset of the time and English cultural norms.\n\nI also found the link between dandyism and toxic masculinity pretty weak - IMO dandyism isn\'t a key driving factor of toxic masculinity. If anything I\'d argue that focusing personal style, grooming and hygiene is not a traditional male gender norm. Pure anecdote here - but I can\'t count the number of times I was called a fag or metro growing up for looking like I cared about how I dressed.\n\nFurther, the links that were made to tie this to toxic masculinity e.g. 90\'s cynicism was pretty poor. Cynicism is tied to postmodernist thinking moreso than dandyism. And this is hardly the sole abode of men - french chic anyone? Indifference is cool across the gender spectrum because it\'s cool.\n\nThe author also doesn\'t take into account the cyclical nature of mens fashion trends - colour has has been utilized heavily in clothes of decades past. Nor does it consider the more recent shift towards androgony and experimental fashion. \n\nThe only reasonable take away here is the affirmation at the end - that we should have more fun with how we dress.

what is so good about raf simons??	Although i admit he has some really great collections such as ss02 i just don’t get the overall appeal of raf.

I’m not saying that I’ve got a lot of New Age answers, but I like using the runway to express as much positive energy as I can get out there while I'm on Earth.\n\nThis is wonderful, and, however vaguely, justifies his supposed vulgarity.

Queering up my wardrobe	"I'm looking for ways to queer up my wardrobe, having worn minimalist clothes for most of my life (and not being blessed with too much knowledge or sense for fashion). I'm 42 now, wearing XL and i have somewhat of a belly while my legs and ass are fairly slim. 

I recently found Henrik Vibskov and \_love\_ his designs, but they're also quite pricey. But his clothes immediately made me go ""yes, that's what i'd mean by queering myself up a little!"" 

Anyway, please be kind, would love to get some advice!"	2	https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashion/comments/110rh2z/queering_up_my_wardrobe/	hdsjulian	2023-02-12 21:57:37	['No images']	[{'author': 'natdass', 'body': ' So what I’m understanding is you have a lot of minimalist clothes that may not be super well fitting, and you would like to inject some fun into your wardrobe. Looking at your references it seems you like bold colors and strong graphic pattern. \n\nSpeaking as someone on a similar journey I would suggest nailing down the basics first. Essentially finding good basics which complement your body type and you feel comfortable in. The clothes you seem interested in would be more accent pieces on top of well curated basics. \n\nWhen it comes to buying more interesting pieces, I suggest finding things which complement your basics. For instance I have a lovely bright red jacket which I’m able to style in a million different ways depending on what basics I apply it with. All black and a pop of red for something more moody, or light colors and red for a happy mood. Etc etc. This will also help you ease yourself into a more colorful aesthetic without being too overwhelming. \n\nIn terms of the price tag, personally I would save up for a couple versatile pieces I’m really in love with. Though if you’re not willing to go beyond a certain price point, I’d suggest thrift stores, second hand branded goods etc etc. Really it just comes down to luck, research and finding cheaper brands which speak to you.

While you have some “eastern” fashion labels here the pieces put together don’t say... “ah yes the classic rugged CDGHP look or the wide bottomed CDGHP look or the new IMHP look where the movement of the fabric dominates over nearly everything else..” and while that makes no difference; obviously anyone can mix up brands and house aesthetics to create something new, I just don’t see this as it. I see this as “hey look at these colors and my Sacai waffles and yeah that’s an SLP shirt there...” type of outfit. Moreover absolutely none of this pays homage to the saturation and texture that the AW20 HP look book offers (since you referenced it), apart from the shorts which you can’t see in this picture at all. There’s no big swathes of solid saturated colors anywhere here which is the highlight of the look book. Patterns there are quite directional whereas here they’re just stacked in a way that makes no sense. \nAs far as the jacket short combo goes, obviously we all know that’s been done plenty but I think perhaps this photo itself where you have the jacket flaring out creates this odd silhouette that’s not really appealing or interesting.

What the hell happened to Dior Homme?	"Dior Homme has this legacy of slim fitting, sophisticated yet luxurious clothing with a bit of edge. As a design powerhouse, the clothing is discreet and speaks for itself. I’m talking about the stuff still in demand today:

Today however it has become a brand for wealthy clowns. Their idiotic monogram is everywhere, the clothes are unremarkable, and today I just received an email about how the designer has ‘dug deep into the archives’ to revive yet another ugly CD logo.

LVMH acquired Dior in 2017 so I’m sure you can see the domino effect from that. LVMH is a power house that has turned around major houses because at the end of the day Fashion is a business which Arnault understands better than anyone else. Why not push out as much product as you can to make the most amount of money as possible while pushing profit margins as high as possible to see what the limit of customers are? That’s pretty much what’s happening, brands like Dior and LV increase their prices every single year on the same product despite decreased quality or no change at all because they can. Are good pieces still made? absolutely but they have found a formula to make pretty much the same amount of money if not more thru hoodies, t shirts, sweats and shit like that because those categories of garments are so universal essentially expanding ur client base which is also why is pushed so hard. Hedi Dior was for skinny tall men, now Dior is for anyone. There’s an influx of new money that want to spend their money (have had these clients) and they’ll buy the $500 T shirt that says Louis Vuitton largely printed to show that newly acquired status. Product is selling so naturally they’re going to continue whatever is working for them despite it being distasteful. Pharrell was appointed creative director of LV, purely based on influence rather merit unfortunately. This shift has been a catalyst for people buying old garments or “archive”.

Introducing Isaac Tobin. My project over the last year has finally been released.

Are you a fan or do you plan on going a different direction? 3) Ever thought of pairing art galleries with fashion shows? I mean, most shows in Melbourne need to attract more foot traffic to generate sales (whatever your specific demographic is. Not the one that come to get drunk off your complementary wine ;)) 4) Do you feel that branding your products will give you more exposure or less sales? I read somewhere how Gucci (or burberry, can't remember) gradually started losing sales over the years ever since they started putting their logo on their clothes...But hey I might be wrong... look at RL or Lacost (hell or ed hardy back in the day) people still buy them despite the huge ass logo.\n\n\n\nThat's all I've got for now.   \nBest of luck m8"", 'score': 5, 'created_utc': '2014-01-31 22:45:29'}, {'author': 'JoelTobinWhite', 'body': ""Feel free to be as honest in your thoughts as you like.

That said, I\'ll definitely play around with it a bit more.

But then I found out that he\'s been messaging underage girls with one of the questions on the profile suggesting that it\'s been with inappropriate intent. That\'s where I draw the line. I hope he\'s reading this because quite frankly I think you should be ashamed of yourself you sick bastard. Why don\'t you grow some balls and go after real women (he\'s 34) as YOURSELF. Is your life that sad that you need to resort to pretending to be someone else? Maybe I have been a little naive by posting pictures of myself uncensored, but that will change, and with no more pictures to post, I\'m sure your pathetic profile will surely dry up. Also for the love of god, why did you choose the shitty fits that you did? I mean [this](http://i.imgur.com/hunUNEc.png)?! C\'mon, I look like the damn woodsman version of Urkel. All in all what you\'re doing is fundamentally ridiculous and calls for a serious re-evaluation of your life. I\'ve been lucky enough to have the love and affection from a woman who very soon I will have been with for more than half of my entire life so I may not be able to relate to you, but at 34 how badly did you mess up that you rely on the emotional support of a ""relationship"" with a minor?\n>>\n>>Anyways all that aside I really hope that OSB start making their roughout boots with a vibram wedge sole, [I would be so happy](http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120506201335/southpark/images/thumb/7/77/Craig.svg/250px-Craig.svg.png)\n>>\n\n\n---\n\n*This is a bot!

Your biggest MF/MFA/FFA influence	"Post the user on MF, MFA, or FFA who has inspired your style or fashion sense the most, and explain why.

Mine will be /u/azurewrath. I just bought a geller sweater and can't wait to throw my toj ma-1 over that once they both arrive. I think his minimalistic style combined with his very simple yet interesting color scheme (not palette - obviously it's just white and black) create a sleek and modern appearance. His outfits are what I would imagine Mies van der Rohe would design had he been a designer.

Who are the most stylish men?	"I should probably do an album, but I'm too lazy for that so I'll just link to a few outfits I like

I'm a big fan of

**Nick Wooster** - [1](http://31.media.tumblr.com/dc53c24a3297cb49b909a67e0d6720c1/tumblr_mheubbvRWU1qdfnb5o1_500.jpg) [2](http://jonnymetbird.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/nick-wooster-style-icon-2.jpg) [3](http://www.soletopia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/nick-wooster-cuffed-camo-pants-and-boots.jpg)

Mainly for his ability to stay true to a lot of classic Menswear but inject his own style and life into his clothing, and also because he dresses in a lot of different styles.

**Kanye West** - [1](http://5.kicksonfire.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/ye.jpg) [2](http://www.sneakerbomb.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/kanye-west-wearing-air-jordan-1-bred-13-570x726.jpg) [3](http://www.fabianvorderegger.com/wp-content/uploads/postimages/Kanye-West-Runaway-ft.-Pusha-T31.jpg) [4](http://hiphop-n-more.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/kanye-Confederate-flag.jpg)

Probably my favorite celebrity from a fashion aspect. Can be very controversial, arrogant, and I think the way he dresses reflects that. To me he is the most important man in fashion that is in Hip-Hop. Is able to marry hip-hop with high fashion very well IMO.

**Eugene Tong** - [1](http://letsrestycle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Style-Profile-Eugene-Tong-15.jpg) [2](http://www.youjustgotspotted.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/EugeneT_MatthewM.jpg) [2](http://i.imgur.com/6bGE0He.jpg) [3](http://38.media.tumblr.com/794fbfa4702b40ec6e4171d9377f4be7/tumblr_n01gfe2AL21qai9woo1_500.jpg)

Only recently found out about him, but dresses really well, and as a young Asian guy myself, really good style inspiration for me (I can admire Kanye's outfits but would never dream of wearing something like him). Eugene was clearly raised a Hypebeast (one of us!!) but takes it a step further with more menswear and high fashion, but you can still see he's a hypebeast at heart.

Sorry I am such a shitty writer, who do you think are the most stylish men? They don't necessarily have to be inspiration because I would never dress like Nick Wooster or Kanye."	0	https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashion/comments/2h2h8j/who_are_the_most_stylish_men/	zuodun	2014-09-21 21:39:49	['No images']	"[{'author': 'LeBrownBear', 'body': '""...a Hypebeast (one of us!!)

Something that can visually anchor the ensemble.\n\n3) If the pants were fuller and less skinny, it would improve this fit alot.\n\n4) Generally, if you want to mix patterns, play with the scale, so larger patterns pair better with smaller ones compared to ones of the same size (like what you are doing here).\n\nA couple examples I can share of my own pattern-matching to help you out: [1](https://i.imgur.com/5Mgb2cI.jpg), [2](https://i.imgur.com/6nqwLlb.jpg), [3](https://i.imgur.com/xAGe4nm.jpg), [4](https://i.imgur.com/N5qbq8M.jpg)"", 'score': 3, 'created_utc': '2018-08-16 22:10:53'}, {'author': 'FatFingerHelperBot', 'body': 'It seems that your comment contains 1 or more links that are hard to tap for mobile users. \nI will extend those so they\'re easier for our sausage fingers to click!\n\n\n[Here is link number 1](https://imgur.com/a/RS2DstE) - Previous text ""one""\n\n[Here is link number 2](https://imgur.com/a/SJhUdnh) - Previous text ""two""\n\n\n\n----\n^Please ^PM ^/u/eganwall ^with ^issues ^or ^feedback! ^| ^[Delete](https://reddit.com/message/compose/?to=FatFingerHelperBot&subject=delete&message=delete%20e4a984r)\n', 'score': 1, 'created_utc': '2018-08-16 10:12:55'}, {'author': 'PsychoWorld', 'body': 'I admire you. \n\nThis would probably work for a specialty event.

Help shopping	"I feel like there is something wrong with me, but I literally cannot go clothes shopping.
I earn enough money to buy nice clothes, but the thought of spending anything on clothes makes me feel awful.
I was shopping today with my wife for holiday clothes and I walk into the store and try to look at the clothes and have a real mental block.  I cannot see anything that takes my interest at all so I end up walking around a shop hating everything and straight out again.
I hate shop attendants talking to me, and I feel like they judge my frankly terrible clothes.
I the only time i will try anything on is when my wife makes me and I will never buy anything because I make excuses that it is too expensive.  As I did today with some £30 Shorts.
Am I alone and how do I get over it because quite frankly I am embarrassed when I see myself in a mirror.

how to afford menswear as an 18-year-old?	I really want to get into some of these brands, raf, rick, jil, damir doma, thom, yohji, cdg, mmm, ysl, givenchy, etc etc but I ain't got parents who are going to pay for it, and I've only got an average ($13/hr) summer job.

What do I have here?	"I was helping out a rather confused Italian man earlier today downtown Toronto when he told me that he was going to give me a gift for all my help. Turns out he was some big hot shot fashion designer. He said that he was robbed late last night and does not have the cash to get them across customs back to Milan. He said that it was middle of the night back in Milan and none of his friends could wire him any money. So, instead of having to discard them, he decides to gift it all to me. 

Now, none of any of this makes any sense to me. Keep in mind that his English was pretty broken. But he handed off the jackets to me anyway and I didn`t turn them down because I guess he really must not need them. 

When I got home I took them out for inspection and they didn`t seem to have anything concealed, like smuggled drugs or the like. He mentioned also that the Italian embassy was closed; so it seems like he went to a lot of trouble before just dumping the jackets on me. 

The thing is, I don`t know much about fashion. So I don`t know what I have here. Could someone here help me identify what I have. 
Please forgive my shitty photography skill.

They make up such a small % of the intended audience that it really doesn't matter.\n\nAlso if you do want to go ahead with saying that the intended audience is made of a large portion of gay/trans people, you would think that they wouldn't be okay with such a demeaning stereotype right? Why is it that the only people I've been told about boycotting from are gay/trans/colored people? \n\n>Lastly, if you think that all rich, white, middle-aged straight dudes are out to get trans people, you are far lost.\n\nNever said that. I am simply asserting that it's a bit weird and abnormal for a representation of a transgendered person to be laid out from the hands of straight, rich, white, middle aged dudes. Not a single trans person was involved in the representation of trans people in this movie. I am not generalizing rich white middle aged dudes. There are a fuckton of rich white middle aged dudes who aren't transphobic and do not have the grandeur to misidentify the trans community. I'm saying these people are all unequipped to handle the situation and it is evident because they all share the same identity. There is no representation.\n\n>Do you also believe that only trans people should write movies with flamboyant trans people in it? If not, how flamboyant can a white writer make a gay/trans person?

End of deal. Only on reddit will I find stereotyping apologists who call themselves lgbtq friendly. It's hypocritical.\n\nHonest question, do you have or know any trans people? Have you asked a single trans person how they feel about the portraiture of trans people in this movie?

It\'s never the case that you see the people who are actually being affected by these social problems making the jokes but the people who make and consume the jokes keep bringing that argument up. Demeaning transgenders by stereotyping them just perpetuates the idea that people who are LGBTQ fit into these specific categories.\n\nthis is the same case for gay people. The media has toned it down but it\'s still a bad problem. I can\'t think how many times I\'ve been called gay because I wear earrings or I dress differently. It\'s annoying and not only does it make gay people feel out of place if they don\'t fit a box, it makes people who aren\'t gay feel less inclined to show signs of femininity because of societal pressure.\n\nI lived in a conservative town and this was a huge problem. It doesn\'t have to be people saying ""you\'re a faggot piece of shit that\'s going to burn in hell"" to make the environment seem uncomfortable.

If pandering to the general public by demeaning transgenderism in 2016 is social reform, then IDK what to tell you man.\n\nIn conclusion, just try to think about the audience that these jokes are meant for.

Tonight while browsing solestruck.com I came across the brand 'Buffalo' **[here](http://www.solestruck.com/mens-buffalo/)** and **[here](http://www.solestruck.com/mens-buffalo-x-solestruck/)** which seems to go for the *fucking huge* platform aesthetic.
