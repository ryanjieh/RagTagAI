Improvement in appearance will come if you taking care of your teeth first and foremost.\n\nHaving said that, I think less is more usually. My teeth are mine, haven't touched them in any way and I don't advocate for people to pursue their vision of unreachable perfection, detriment to their dental health. Wearing braces or invisalign is a good thing however. Overlapping teeth obviously doesn't look great, but also because not being able to reach part of your teeth or having things get stuck between them is going to harm your teeth. You will also have uneven yellowness.\n\nI don't have any specific and unique routine to be honest but I recommend that you would only use approved products. So many people hunt for products that advertise to give you the whitest teeth without reading what else these products contain or even lack! These cheap money grabs are going to at best help you remove the surface stains a day quicker, which serve no real purpose. You know what else will give your teeth a bad and uneven tone? Bad oral health! Overconsuming acidic foods and drinks is a teeth killer too. I treat myself when I am out of course but I don't drink 4 cans of energy drinks a day and stuff myself full of candy every evening even though I can consume both occasionally - It's all about moderation. I also have a strict diet when I'm home. Secret tip, most people mess up their diet by being bored. Keep yourself occupied and your diet will be easier to keep up with. On top of that, don't forget to floss, mouth wash.\n\nYour teeth will gradually become whiter in a more healthy way if you take care of them instead of trying to cover it up with expensive money grab tooth pastes and tik tok trends. Of course you can go in and whiten your teeth professionally but don't do it too often. In worst case, use the strips, some of them are ADA approved.\n\nEither way, as I said, improving oral health will indirectly make your teeth whiter and more glowy. You can do this by improving your diet, going for regular dental cleanings is helpful too. Take your time in the evening and don't stress when you brush, floss and wash. It's also never too late to get braces if your teeth are overlapping."", 'score': 3, 'created_utc': '2024-04-30 01:10:28'}, {'author': 'BunnyWithBuns', 'body': 'I brush 2-3 times a day, floss every night, see the dentist every 6 months, and use whitening strips occasionally.

[Discussion] Unpopular Opinion: magnus ronning dresses like shit	"Alright I already know that title is gonna trigger you neckbeards so hard youll drop your fuckin tendies but hear me out.

I think [Magnus Ronning](https://www.instagram.com/magnus/), fashion youtuber, fits are pretty damn garbage. Honestly, I don't see any way that I could give definite proof, because fashion is so inherently subjective. Regardless, I think my opinion should at least open the floor to discussion over what others thoughts might be. I think it's too easy to let yourself be swayed to the norm, so maybe consider my title.

Personally, I think the only reason he made it out of the voting for BDY is not because he dresses objectively well, but because he's overhyped garbage, with a fervent fanbase that will support him and suck his dick over any achievement, no matter how small or insignificant.

All banter aside, however, I legitimately enjoy his videos, follow him on instagram, etc. This isn't me pussying out though, I'm sticking to my guns on this unless an especially compelling opinion is put forth.

Downvotes have been turned back on	"We've come to the decision to reenable the downvote button. This was initially removed due to abuse - downvoting people for no reason and generally creating a negative feeling for newcomers and people with any sort of opinion. Since then the community has grown a lot larger, but we also feel it has grown a lot friendlier. As such, the downvote button is now visible to all users.

We would ask that you do not abuse this, and follow reddiquette by only downvoting content that does not add to the discussion. The downvote button is *not* a dislike button.

Since the ""face"" of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the ""face"" (this guy (ツ) ).  The backslash is reddit\'s escape character (basically a character used to say that you don\'t want to use a special character in order to format, but rather you just want it to display).  So your first ""\\\\_"" is just saying ""hey, I don\'t want to italicize (ツ)"" so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since it\'s just an escape character.  After this you still want the arm, so you have to add two more backslashes (two, not one, since backslash is an escape character, so you need an escape character for your escape character to display--confusing, I know).  Anyways, I guess that\'s my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol\n\n***CAUTION: Probably very boring edit as to why you don\'t need to escape the second underscore, read only if you\'re super bored or need to fall asleep.***\n\nEdit: The reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore (which doesn\'t have an escape character) doesn\'t have another underscore with which to italicize.  Reddit\'s formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text, then you put the text you want to format, then you put the character again.  For example, you would type \\_italicize\\_ or \\*italicize\\* in order to get _italicize_.  Since we put an escape character we have \\\\\\_italicize\\_ and don\'t need to escape the second underscore since there\'s not another non-escaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them.  So technically you could have written ¯\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_(ツ)\\\\\\_/¯ but you don\'t need to since there\'s not a second non-escaped underscore.  You ***would*** need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line (but not if you used a line break, aka pressed enter twice).  If you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the non-escaped underscore to italicize.  To show you this, you can type _italicize* and it should not be italicized.', 'score': 3, 'created_utc': '2017-01-18 02:42:22'}, {'author': 'None', 'body': 'Js, looks a lot better than the call of duty poster that had been there for about 3 years.

He can keep the basic formula of hats, anime top, pants , and sneakers but just tighten it up and make it cleaner overall.

Bunch of idiots wearing high priced garments without having much style, or swagger to it .  \n\nAll the great streetwear stores are now defunct because of this....(Collete, HUF, Stussy, Undefeated etc...). The brands they even carry aren't streetwear anymore.   Streetwear was a necessity when it first occurred because no one in the inner major cities  could afford what we saw on TV (at the time bad boy records and death row records were all decked out in Versace, Gucci,  Vanson leathers etc).  The very essence of Streetwear was many homegrown urban designs made by local well known artists (Kaws, Stash, Espo, Futura, etc).  Important collabs was the other part.  And this is what made it fun.  You had to travel from store to store to all the local boutiques to cop.   \n\nNow it's a joke .  I'm not saying fashion isn't amazing it is.  It's allowed people to look further and dig deeper to find more exclusive pieces or designers ...... But it's not honest.  People are wearing brands they have no connection with and know nothing about..... ENTER: HYPEBEASTS who killed and destroyed streetwear.  (That's a whole different topic). And the mega conglomerates (the high end European fashion houses are the ones who benefitted from this). They prostitute our culture and took everything away to Target the new younger generation (because all third previous clients are getting older and just want traditional looking items). That's why LV was smart and got Virgil Abloh on board.\n\n\nBut again to answer your question..... There is no such thing as streetwear anymore.....I think it should just be HIGH END BOUTIQUE clothing at this point.

Clearing out my Yeezy collection	"For year's I've loved Yeezy, I've waited in line for hours countless times to get all the drops and to this day I rotate my 350s everyday. I think they're the most comfortable casual shoe I've ever worn and they always draw eyes. Unfortunately, because the brand is so closely tied to Ye and with Ye's recent anti-Semite comments I now just feel disgusting wearing any of my Yeezys.

My roommate and close friend is Jewish and I feel embarassed owning Yeezys and leaving them by our front door. It's so sad but I'll be clearing out my entire collection, I'll probably sell at a discount to get rid of it all as soon as possible.

I feel like wearing Yeezy is like supporting Ye and I just can't do it anymore. Luckily Adidas has been dropping Yeezy rip-offs so I will probably switch to those and go back to my Jordans for awhile."	11	https://www.reddit.com/r/streetwear/comments/ye9l8u/clearing_out_my_yeezy_collection/	chrisco571	2022-10-26 21:31:56	No images	"[{'author': 'BladeCoomer2049', 'body': 'ok', 'score': 270, 'created_utc': '2022-10-26 21:47:08'}, {'author': 'None', 'body': 'So when ye sold confederate flag clothes you were cool?

Feel free to make your own posts on why you left /r/Streetwear (not Buzzfeed)

#1 Edgy/Anime Fits
Currently I feel like this sub is a circlejerk of edgy ass anime core looking outfits. It's fucking crazy that people think bullshit like [this](https://i.imgur.com/R9hQ4q5.jpg) looks cooler than simple and  basic like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/PalaceClothing/comments/91zvpo/wdywt_another_colorful_fit/).

#2 We get it, you thrift

The next circlejerk that I don't fuck with are all the bois that puts together crummy ass lookin fits but gets circlejerked just because the fit is thrifted.

#3 Everyone covering their faces

Why the fuck is everyone covering/editing their faces when you should be proud and own ur fits. Honestly it's prob cuz everyone knows that most of the fits nowadays are straight ass.

#4 PANTS

What happened to wearing normal bottoms?

[Discussion] Unpopular opinion: Vetements sucks	"They rip off designs (Balenciaga Sock Runner, don't argue on this)

They hop on trends and take their design ""too far"", even by fashion standards (their recent dad shoe is similar to Triple S, but just looks 10x worse)



Extremely overpriced. I get all designer is overpriced, but think of it this way; Gucci Socks are $100 and have an embroidered design on them that's actually sewed in (by a machine, but at least it's there). Vetements socks are just... Socks with the design and have better than average threading on them. And they're the same price! 

$1000 hoodies, expensive ass T-shirts that range from ridiculous to half-decent (but never worth the price, mind you). 


Also, the emoji shoes for 1k is just ridiculous. They really don't look nice at all. 



Feel free to discuss this with me, 98% of my opinions are completely subjective, and I'm willing to discuss all aspects of my opinion. I just dislike Vetements because it is overpriced even for designer, and just takes things out of proportion so they don't look good anymore.

Balenciaga is also Denma, though I\'m sure many people have pointed this out to you. You can\'t rip off your own design, get a grip. Also, reebok came out with the sock runner which the vetements sock runner is based off of, before the balenciaga one came out. \n\n2. Vetements is setting the trends. The original genetically modified reeboks came out before the triple S. They just happened to release a new exclusive colorway recently.\n\n3. You get decreasing marginal utility the more you pay for clothes, particularly designer brands. No one\'s paying thousands for ""quality"". You really think it costs a ton more to embroider some crap with a sewing machine onto a sock? Also, vetements socks retail for about half what Gucci does. This just reflects a poor understanding of high fashion and its prices.\n\n4. Vetements hoodies are popular for a reason. They are the impetus and created the trend for the cropped hoodie with long arms + wide hood look, which has been emulated by other brands to shit.

Posing for fit pics	"I love looking at fit pics, they give me inspiration for future fits for my self, but these poses that people do for their pics are just so god damn annoying. I'm talking about the poses where you look down at the floor or you put your hand on your head like you just forgot your keys in your house. So just keep in mind change it up a bit go somewhere nice or somewhere that fits the clothing and if you don't wanna show your face edit it and blur it out. I hope I can see a change in fit pic posing one day thank you.

Hopefully he's using some decent materials because those are mid to high range prices.\n\nEdit: I was wrong. Only the first long sleeve is $120. The second is $160. The third is $200.

Don't upvote - im on the verge of giving up	"So today I went to Seattle, to find the dope ass UA rose/lavender CW hoodie. Lived a lil bit far, 2 hours bus ride to Seattle and had set my mind on the two UA stores there. Went to the first store, walking from the bus stop which is like a 10 minutes walk, and only to be crushed by the fucking brown/beige hoodie. And then I remembered the people of reddit saying, ""hey the hoodies u lookin for are sitting forever in my place"". I died inside, by the hope that they gave me but fret not, ANOTHER store is waiting for me....after a ~1 ish mile walk, with a semi dead feet, praying that this store will have the meme hoodie, the grail of memes i've always ever wanted. well, ive reached the store, only to be turned down by the same hoodie colourway :))))) At this point I just don't know what to think anymore but to write this crap. Fuck my life. I've never been so depressed about a hoodie, or anything really related to clothing. But those walks back and fourth really got me. Sorry if you think that this is a shitpost but i guess you can say it that way because I'm feeling the shittest right now. Well I guess to those who has the hoodie please appreciate it as some people have went measures to get them. Guess I'm one of the unlucky ones.

Rant about expensive denim	"To begin with 100 Euros for a pair of jeans is expensive for me.
I'd like to talk about this range of the denims. They aren't worth it imho.

After getting 2 crotch blowouts on my 2 pairs of nudies I'm done with the brand. I took care of them, washed them 1-1 time in 6 months and they look 10/10 except the crotch.. on both f*cking pairs..

While wearing them I always felt uncomfortable sitting on basically anything, in fear of getting my precious jeans dirty..

Also I just realised that I don't want to spend a lot (for me) on pieces that I exploit in a way I exploit my denims. I live in central EU and use the bus daily. I ain't buying expensive jeans to sit in somebodys dried piss on the bus.

I guess I'm sticking to sales on levi's, maybe nudie (but no more than 60/pair) and [cheap monday looks good too.](https://www.instagram.com/p/BcDUZZoj0jg/?hl=en&taken-by=justusf_hansen)

ONLY NY quality is terrible. Don’t waste your money	"I don’t know how these guys are still in business or how they’re still putting out low quality stuff despite their insane markups. I purchased one of their  “heavyweight” hoodies (heavyweight in quotations as there’s no way you can wear that and stay warm under 60*) back in 2015 and upon receiving it, the logo was already cracked so I sent it back in and exchanged it for another hoodie. After 2 wears and 1 wash (cold, inside out and air dry), I started noticing it pilling up like crazy. I put the hoodie into my closet and barely touched it since. Recently they had a sale that I bought another hoodie and a Snapback hat from. Guess what? Same pilling incident even though this is a champion hoodie. It’s quite peculiar because my other champion hoodies haven’t pilled up quite like theirs has with much longer use. Not sure but this clearly isn’t an isolated incident as it’s happened on 2 of their products. Also, the snapback is flimsy af with no structure and after 1 month of normal use, the navy has faded to a washed look. 

This company, like ASSC, is good at marketing but their products are not worth even a 1/5th of the price they ask. I’m certain I’m not the only one complaining about their quality, I just haven’t found many posts on this sub calling them out. If you’re looking for quality, this isn’t the brand for you.

[Discussion] Explain the appeal in today's trends on this subreddit	"I've been out of the loop for a while. Before I was gone ironic outfits were just that... Ironic 

Now I'm seeing fits that would be complete shit being praised like it's groundbreaking. I'm heavily confused and I'm not trying to sound like a dick. 

But 2 years ago if you came in here wearing cropped pants, a graphic tee tucked into a Walmart belt and some random athletic shoes. You would've been torn apart saying your proportions are off and irony isn't *actually* cool.

Now it seems the norm is irony and it **is*"" actually cool and I don't understand it. 

Now I get fashion is all about trends and what nots but with this style I'm seeing a lot now. I am honestly legitimately confused as to how you all think this looks good. I'm not saying it always looks bad because I've seen some people here who pull it off extremely well. But at the same time their clothes are still fitted and it doesn't look like it's supposed to be ironic.

Now we don't have to pretend black American culture does not heavily influence fashion trends. Back in the 90s we were all still homophobic and if you wore tight pants it made you catch the gay.

The New boyz arguably were very key pioneers in the skinny pants movement. Despite who was doing it before them doesn't really matter considering they had the youth of the black American communities wearing neon skinny jeans. 

These pushes in the direction of fitted clothes made more rappers stand out to the 2009 generation of fashion trends. Whether they were already on the wave or not does not matter. 

What I'm trying to say is things change, fashion evolves and eventually goes full circle. As more influence from different idols, cultures and communities come in. It's bound to have a drastic change.

What I don't get is how we got where we are exactly. Is it meme culture? Was it Kanye? Was it a specific area? For most trends you can visibly see that it's cool and you can explain *why* it's cool. Also who it's cool to and why it's cool to them.

Basically I only see this type of fashion on this subreddit. I want to know why it's cool and why it's cool to *you?*

And the tucked shirt is essential to my personal style, I like to wear a baggy tee tucked, it works with my body as I have wide hips and this masks that, making me look more square and less like I bulge out in the middle. Also i like it because it breaks up the top and bottom half of the fit and shows your belt, I can\'t imagine ever not tucking my shirt to be honest. And to answer your question, it\'s not ironic. To elaborate, in recent years some thingfs that may seem ironic, like the chunky sneakers and 2000s printed buttons shirts have become trendy, you can thank demna (designer for balenciaga and vetements) for that one. I totally understand why you don\'t like it, it\'s ugly. But to me thats what makes it look good? To me I don\'t like to dress in an aesthetically pleasing or normal way, to my eyes, that\'s boring.

[DISCUSSION] Are light wash jeans still in style, and worth aquiring?	"You most commonly see light wash jeans associated with the palewave trend, which from what I have read is pretty much over at this point. But is it still worth it to buy a pair, and if so, what do they go best with?

I personally think that light-wash jeans should still have a place in your wardrobe, because there are still plenty of good fits that you can build off of them. For example, I think that they would go good with an unmarked black or white crew neck tee, or maybe something like an [Adidas California T-shirt](https://www.google.com/search?q=adidas+california+t+shirt&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiCnrXy7r3aAhWT0YMKHVR7Bq0Q_AUI0AMoAA&biw=1256&bih=667). A black or olive bomber can also really make them look good. Footwear-wise, they really look nice with all-white sneakers, and as cliche as they are, Vans Old Skools. They also look really good distressed, or just normal.

I'm no expert for sure, though, for all I know the fits that I'm thinking of could be dated at this point, so what are your guys' thoughts/opinions on light-wash jeans?"	2	https://www.reddit.com/r/streetwear/comments/8d1rot/discussion_are_light_wash_jeans_still_in_style/	sleepingonstones	2018-04-18 01:09:33	No images	"[{'author': 'buopp', 'body': ' fuck whatever is popular and fuck trends.

The Truth	Hey guys, So as some of you know I am kind of new to streetwear. I already think that the culture surrounding flex brands like nike, supreme, stussy, diamond supply etc. is hella chill. I have always liked clothes and it's cool to see people copping fits that can bring new life to a simple shoe like the Nike AF1 cocaine white. The problem with my newfound interest in streetwear is that it didn't come from me or my curiosity. TBH and to make a long story short there was this fine girl at my school that I had a huge crush on, I tried to hit on her and ask her to prom and stuff but she always turned me down. So one day I was so frustrated that I straight up asked her why she wasn't vibing with me and she told me that I was a decent looking guy, but I had no style and I dressed like a total herb. I asked her what good style was and she told me she liked guys that were into streetwear. So basically I started spending my allowance on streetwear stuff and now I am sort of starting to get into the culture but at the same time I feel insecure that this is all because of my crush on a girl. Do you guys think this is a legitamate reason to get into streetwear or not? how did you get into streetwear? I'm just curious becasue if I'm going to invest my time and energy into something, i want to feel like I have a good reason 4 it.	2	https://www.reddit.com/r/streetwear/comments/36cguv/the_truth/	stuntboy420	2015-05-18 07:28:33	No images	"[{'author': 'None', 'body': '[deleted]', 'score': 24, 'created_utc': '2015-05-18 14:18:59'}, {'author': 'blacktothafuture', 'body': ""Get her interest, then curve that bitch, parabola curve, curve her like that trill bitch Siri, curve her like nicki minaj's ass\n\nThen fuck her best friend, real nigga shit. \n\nSquad squad."", 'score': 13, 'created_utc': '2015-05-18 19:58:25'}, {'author': 'None', 'body': '[deleted]', 'score': 13, 'created_utc': '2015-05-18 20:44:56'}, {'author': 'SoSway', 'body': 'Yea he has mentioned cocaine whites like 50 times', 'score': 9, 'created_utc': '2015-05-18 23:00:38'}, {'author': 'stuntboy420', 'body': ""What do you mean by troll?

How to: SUMMER STREETWEAR FOR BUFF GUYS 2016	"*Fuck you /r/streetwear, first and foremost, for making me do this shit...* - me, maybe

[Quick inspo album featuring Kanye (""all chest, no legs"") West  and Ryan (""you look like you're photoshopped!"") Gosling](http://imgur.com/gallery/p9u9b)

* **Sun's out, guns out!**

Are you buff? Do you work out? Is the sun out? Are you at the beach? *Why are you wearing a shirt*?

If you really need to wear a shirt (when you're going into an enclosed establishment, or something) just carry a shirt in a bag or something. Or tuck one in your back pocket (that's what I did during festival season).

* **You can wear almost anything and look good in it**

It's summer, so layering is pretty inadvisable unless you live in, like, Australia or the other uninhabitable places in the world. My advice? **K. I. S. S.** Keep it simple, stupid. Shirt + pants/shorts + shoes.

Save all your money for the dope outerwear you're gonna rock during the cold seasons.

Unpopular Streetwear Opinions thread.	"Just a thread to post your seemingly unpopular streetwear opinions. I'll start with mine.

1. Fuck flexing , buy it because its dope , 90% wont know wtf it is anyways , youre only flexing on the type of people who read this sub. 


2. There are no staples in streetwear unless you want to look like everyone else on /r/Streetwear - In that case beat up some sk8 his and wear them with every outfit.


3. There are better sneakers than just stan smiths , sk8 hi's and flex shoes like Rick Owens 


4. Beat shoes arent the wave, they dont look bad , but fresh out the box still looks better IMO. I still think its worth taking care of your sneakers. 


5. Loud fits have a place in streetwear , you dont have to walk outside looking like Justin Bieber everyday. (new JB)


6. Having a small rotation of sneakers is fine , but id rather have 50+ pairs

7. Pls stop being so robotic in how you approach streetwear , its supposed to be fun."	1	https://www.reddit.com/r/streetwear/comments/498fcq/unpopular_streetwear_opinions_thread/	None	2016-03-06 18:13:51	No images	"[{'author': 'Fatman0093', 'body': 'These threads are stupid and say the same shit over and over.

[Discussion] hmmmm 🤔 should we associate slave labor to h&m like we associate rape to vlone? or wife beater to ripndip?	"hhmmmmmmmmm

Allow me to first preface this post by saying I don’t like any of the brands mentioned above.

But people who wear H&M products of slave labor and judge those who wear or like vlone or ripndip not because of butt uglay af designs, but because of what their owners do, like why? 0.o

Bc if you’re actually woke wouldn’t you discriminate and discourage H&M and other fast fashion brands as much as you discriminate and discourage vlone and ripndip? (The answer is yes)

So why do you keep shopping at H&M knowing their owners do horrible things???? You already know better not to support the horrible owners of vlone and ripndip!!!!!!?????

Why do u not shame ppl who wear H&M as you shame those who wear vlone and ripndip? :0

Why you acknowledge the problem of woman abuse yet turn a blind eye at slave labor?

I also know that this post is going to look like borderline gatekeeping, but bare with me. This thread is simply my opinion, take it as you like. As you all know, the whitelist was removed from the subreddit, allowing everyone and anyone to post a \[wdywt\] thread on the sub. In my eyes, this has caused a number of problems.

&#x200B;

* The biggest flaw that this has caused (to me personally) is the extreme lack in discussion posts now. Sure they still exist, but they are simply flooded out of the sub's ""Hot"" feed due to the literal waves of fit pics. ""But there's a tab for discussion threads at the top, go there if you want to read some discussions!"" They rarely have much actual ""discussion"" going on in them. The few discussion posts that you can find by scrolling down a ton don't have nearly as many responses and conversations as they did in the past. They got shoved to the background. I know discussions still happen in the replies to wdywt posts but the topic driven posts with intense opinions and defenses are a thing of the past.

&#x200B;

* Remember when the sub banned mirror pics? Remember when the sub banned low quality pictures? New wdywt posters don't. Old (whitelisted) posters were forced to take actual quality pictures with their pictures, and even tended to get creative with their edits to showcase their outfits. Scrolling through the sub I am bombarded with blurry, over/under exposed, and grainy pictures. Quality is objective and I totally understand that, but people used to put actual effort into their posts. Like come on, [flash mirror pics](https://www.reddit.com/r/streetwear/comments/arnuuc/wdywt_one_of_my_favorite_outfits_atm/)? Are we actually regressing this much? (Not saying that this is everyone, lots of users for the most part are still good in this regard, but the really new ones \[you can tell\] are obviously lacking.)

&#x200B;

* **FASHION AND GOOD TASTE IS OBJECTIVE AND ALL UP TO PERSONAL TASTE.** That being said, there are quite a few of these fits that I dislike. And apparently you people don't really like them either, since most of the pictures I am going to include in the album at the bottom of this post have zero or negative post karma. I understand that a lot of ""tasteful fashion"" is expensive and difficult to get into, but I feel like some of these fits belong in a different subreddit, like r/frugalfits or something. Everyone wants to get feedback on their outfits, but they're usually just met with downvotes and roasting replies, both of which are inefficient to the cause. This type of situation is where the wdywt daily thread shines. People purposefully go into that thread with the intent of looking at fits both good and bad (especially since its usually filled with non-whitelisted users) and want to give criticism and help. With that whitelist gone, there is simply too much to handle.

&#x200B;

[examples](https://imgur.com/a/5DVYrE1) (not all of these fits are bad, just the quality of the photo proves point #2)

&#x200B;

My solution proposal: Bring back the daily thread! Except this time, mod's actively whitelist members that they see posting good content in the thread, as actual quality should be rewarded. This way, front page isn't always the same 15 people posting their fits and we keep the low quality posts that need improvement isolated. Being whitelisted was a goal for many users in the community, and it should be a goal for newcomers too, encouraging them to improve and cultivate their own taste and style.

&#x200B;

Now that you've heard my side, what do you guys think?

How do you feel about the new posters / outfits / ""flow"" of the subreddit?

How do you think this will improve (or hurt) the sub in the long run?

PSA: Don't order from Domobeads	"Hey everyone, on the fourth I ordered some bracelets from Domobeads after hearing about how good they were.

It's safe to say I won't be ordering from them again, and I definitely will tell my friends not to order from Domobeads.

I'm still out 15 bucks for the time being, and from my understanding I can't do a credit card chargeback unless the total is more than 50 dollars which sucks.

yeezys, skintight distressed jeans, long line tees etc... bro those were the glory days of streetwear. it was different enough to stand out but not wacky enough to be considered weird. now u have people bringing out weird ass cropped trousers and some funny kimonos and other shits like that and saying 'yeah bro this is fashion right here' are u kidding me dude like wtf?? u look like a weirdo. anyway what im tryna say is that the fuckboy/hypebeast era was the best. even the most basic fits felt exciting. now i see people dressing themselves like my history teacher just to look different its crazy bro

[DISCUSSION] Editing your fit pics is worse than sitting in them	"The idea of a fit pic is to show off your outfit, not your editing ability. Edits seem to have what psychology calls a halo effect, or the tendency for an impression created in one area to influence opinion in another area. Plus, manipulating reality to enhance your fit is something that does not fit well with me.

While there are a lot of examples out there, I don’t want to call out anyone by name. I think what I’m trying to say should be obvious enough though.

I understand how sitting fit pics can be problematic as you can’t judge the pant shoe interaction and waist line of the fit; however, we don’t *need* to be shown every aspect of the fit to form an opinion of it. If we complain about pant shoe interaction and waist, are we also gonna complain when we can’t see the back of the fit either? Or a side view? Having to see pant shoe interaction and waist line is, imo, arbitrary in forming an opinion of a fit. I get a lot of inspo from IG and many pics are just sitting and not even full body.

Anyways, the point of this thread was that I think if there are talks about banning sitting fit pics, then there should be talks about edits as well, and that banning sitting fit pics is being too stringent.

What do you guys think?

Thanks

While I disagree with how you voice your opinions I think they do raise interesting points whether you mean to do so otherwise.\n\nCorrect me if im wrong but i feel that your dislike of editing, [unnatural and contrived](https://www.reddit.com/r/streetwear/comments/7rtrw6/whats_your_unpopular_streetwear_opinion/dszsiwr/) poses ultimately comes from the idea that being cool should be effortless. Like if you were to ask me what I thought the coolest type of fitpic would be, it would be a candid streetshot of an unaware nobody midwalk, dressed amazingly. I reckon that its a part of the reason that pointofreferences\' posts generally take off, because theres a perceived lack of narcissism to them as he is the one asking to take someone else\'s photo.\n\nHOWEVER, the way I see it, whats more contrived and vain than putting effort into a fitpic, is putting up the front that it is candid and effortless. We don\'t have people taking photos of us candidly in perfect lighting all the time, because it is simply not possible. Your demand that peoples\' fitpics should conform in a way that is both effortless yet good is, in my opinion, self contradictory and idealistic. Of course, its exceptionally vain and not ""cool"" to spend 15 minutes adjusting your belt so it hangs just right, or to have to look for perfect lighting so that the folds of your black on black on black clothing are illuminated in the perfect way, but to pretend that an immense amount of effort and narcissistic thought isnt already being invested by every single person who is into fashion is just an odd way to safekeep some idea of coolness you have.\n\nAs for editing itself, I would agree that i dislike edits that make it harder to make out the fit, but not with the use of editing itself. There are many practical uses such as fixing lighting, visibility etc, but to me it more so comes under the fact that what I try to present isnt always some illusion of candidness, but the best possible photo. Since it is not usually possible to have perfect candid pictures of myself on hand every time i have a new outfit, why fumble around in some middle ground of pretense and just commit to artificially making it the best photo for the outfit?\n\nSoz for the wall of text :\\^) its just that i kinda get the whole disliking tryhard thing, unless u hand on heart say this isnt related to that in which case sike lmao', 'score': 42, 'created_utc': '2018-09-10 04:10:19'}, {'author': 'EmArKay_11', 'body': ""< **this sitting son of a bitch** doesn't think that a slim cropped trouser and carhartt cargos interact with shoes differently and basically, you are fucking stupid\n\nHow? ...Just watch this free video >"", 'score': 35, 'created_utc': '2018-09-09 22:09:42'}, {'author': 'GalacTech', 'body': 'What if I’m in a wheelchair.', 'score': 33, 'created_utc': '2018-09-09 22:07:02'}, {'author': 'None', 'body': '[deleted]', 'score': 27, 'created_utc': '2018-09-09 22:01:19'}, {'author': 'None', 'body': 'people just like to personalize their fit pics with their own edits\n\n', 'score': 19, 'created_utc': '2018-09-09 21:38:19'}, {'author': 'daetsmlolliw', 'body': 'Because it adds something interesting to something less interesting?

[DISCUSSION] HATE the term Streetwear!!	"Disclaimer, this is my opinion and not personal. Meaning, don't comment if you don't like it

[SELF EXRPESSION](https://preview.redd.it/ewcdcu1cnzb11.jpg?width=620&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7136076da712c569dae540f2e3ee179a5ab4965b)

Well maybe not ""hate"" but certainly not a fan of the term

Growing up in NYC, you never got ready in the morning and said ""Let me put on my streetwear!' or when you see your friends fresh AF ""Yo word! That streetwear is fire my guy!!""

Nope! it was simply putting on your freshest clothes that best represent your day. The way you felt. Your mood. Or just some fly sh\*t you put together.

Wether you were matching  new Vasquez or rocking the latest Spyder jacket (sh\*t were expensive lol)

Or Prada sneakers with the Iceberg sweater! At the end of the day, it was simply the way you looked. Your eclectic form of  expression. It was your everyday look.

Streetwear (that term) represented more your style. Your swagger. It was also an escape from your reality whether good or bad. It was identity to a group of dreamers. Free thinkers.  A way to set you apart from the rest of this mystical word outside of your hood.

To me now (it may be true or not) the term is more isolating than before. It has become a way to identify a class of ""I don't give a f\*ck attitude of people"". Well bruh, the ones who grew up dressing that way, gave a fuck. It was a form of independence and self expression.

It didn't make me feel as if I needed your attention. It was simply my reality

I feel like I can go on for days.

Going to still use the term ""streetwear"" cause it's the only one I know :-)

Jean Pockets. Why?	"I don’t like jean pockets, especially with skinny or slim jeans. They just don’t make any sense, they’re incredibly hard to put my hand in and don’t create a natural relaxed feeling in my arm when my hands are in them. The littler pocket inside the pocket that I used to use for my coins makes the skin under my fingernail feel like it’s ripping off since it’s such a tight fit and they’re so small. The vertical high insertion of your hands makes your elbows flail out like a chicken or give you some unnatural bend in your wrist.

Now, slash pockets give a way more natural bend to your arm, it doesn’t weirdly curve your wrist, and it carries your hand easier. It flows better and gives a more relaxed and easy vibe when you want to keep your hands in your pockets. All jeans should move to this style of pocket ASAP.

What is streetwear?	"So lately the question of what should be considered streetwear has been controversial. Honestly I don't believe it should be. As a community a part of a hobby I think its important to understand what your own interest is.  According to r/streetwear in the sidebar:

""We are a community of fashion enthusiasts who are inspired by clothing styles derived by skateboard, surf, hip hop, and retro 80s/90s sensibilities. Streetwear continues to evolve in modernity, but tends to be distinguishable as an urban style to the general public.""

I agree with this. Its a pretty good explanation of what streetwear is. I think its important to note that streetwear has a distinguishable urban feel to it. So as a community of fashion enthusiasts why does it seem people on this subreddit are okay with different styles being posted here? I've looked into many different fashion styles in my time and the communities around these styles are very specific as to what their style is and what isn't there style. Yet the streetwear community here doesn't seem to care about what acutally is streetwear or not. Some people will say ""Its what you wear on the streets"" but if you take harajuku for example, there is a whole variety of styles worn from lolita to rockabilly and those aren't classified as streetwear styles. It just seems very strange to me that there are so many people in this community who don't care about the classification of streetwear.

So, how do you feel about this situation?

"[FS] ""You ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy in your Serato ?"" t-shirts."	"Hey guys ! I'm selling [the first Yeezy t-shirt I've made last week](http://i.imgur.com/4wRkMiM.jpg). 

For now, there is only one made and I'm willing to sell it since I screenprinted it on an Old Navy t-shirt that fit for me a tad too small.

Size Medium, worn 3 times, the only flaw is that I removed the tag located on the side of the tee too fast so basicly I teared a small hole in it :(. BUT, It can be easily sewn back to normal by a loving mother or someone who can sew. The quality of the tee is pretty decent too but it do fit kinda slim. 

I'm looking for 20$ for it. I can ship anywhere in the world but you're paying the shipping fees. I will priorise the highest offer or If you're located in Montréal, we could easily meet up so I will priorise you. 


Here is more info concerning the tee : Eventually (that mean when I'll get a fucking job...) I will eventually print some more in different colorways using the same technique that provide such a pretty nice printing since the ink used in the making of the print is literally INTO the fabric. This super durable printing (It dosen't fade alot and wont crack) is kinda pricey tho' so if I decide to eventually commercialise it, the price of the tee shirt would be around 35/40 bucks and I will choose another type of high quality t-shirt to make sure it fit really clean on everyone who will eventually purchase.

[DISCUSSION / META] I'm sorry, but when did we become r/malefashion ?	Streetwear was all about expression and creative use of basic clothes, but now every WDYWT is just someone else in over-priced, name-brand all-black. For example, if you want to wear a Gucci belt, go for it, but that shouldn't be the only thing that sets you apart. The whole point of streetwear was to avoid relying on brands, but that's what most of this is now. I swear, I came to this subreddit because it had interesting outfits and *didn't* like the shit on r/malefashion.

Extremely Important Scam Help	"I got sent 2.3 thousand USD on Tuesday by a person on grailed. She said her brother went on her account and bought the shirt for that much by accident. She doesen't even want the shirt all she wants is a refund but this seems way too good to be true...

EDIT: I refunded her lmao... but the reason I thought it was too good to be true was that she was saying I could keep half and being way too kind about it. I ended up refunding the full amount because she followed me on ig and shes a student from France so she most likely needs the money. I read it a lot of things about how this could be a scam so thats why I got so skeptical lmao, sorry for coming across like a dickhead xd

List of all streetwear flash sale sites	"First a little background, every season brands are left with leftover articles from that season that (obviously) cant sell, in part because offering a luxury product at a discount every season hurts brand image, so they pass them off to sample sale sites which sell the goods for them at highly discounted prices ""on the low"" so to speak, all sites are 1000% legit and Gilt had a feature in Forbes (http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2008/0225/070.html).  Some of the sites I believe you can sign up for by yourself or get put on a waiting list to sign up while others are strictly by invitation only.  


[**Gilt Group**](http://www.gilt.com/invite/gilded) – Probably the highest end sample saler along with MyHabit, has stocked Y3, Gant, Richard Chai, RL Purple Label, John Varvatos, Common Projects; mostly high-end designer labels at reduced prices


[**MyHabit**](http://myhabit.com/ref=qd_mr_per_l?refcust=IRXCRHA67SABIWZPRGMMKWKT3U) – Luxury sample sale site backed by eCommerce titan Amazon.com, nice selection of high-end labels (Armani, Rick Owens, Damir Doma, DRKSHDW, Prada, you get the idea =p) for VERY discounted prices.


[**Belle & Clive**](http://www.belleandclive.com/invite/35cbb1drf?partner=friend) – Another designer sample sale site, still in its Beta stages, started by luxury retailer BlueFly; stocks high-end designer goods; Prada, Ferragamo, Hermes, YSL, Zegna, Y3, Gucci, etc. etc. 

		
[**Hautelook**](http://www.hautelook.com/invite/KPerez125?sid=99992) – Sample sale site somewhere in between high-end and streetwear. 


[**PLNDR**](http://www.plndr.com/?r=9154981&utm_source=invite&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=personalurl) – Strictly streetwear sample site, owned by Karmaloop, stocks BLVCK SCVLE, Play Cloths, BBC, etc etc.  One of the more popular sample sale sites among ""laymen"" of the fashion world.


[**JackThreads**](http://www.jackthreads.com/invite/sableecstasy) – Another streetwear retailer; owned by the Thrillist group. Similar offerings to PLNDR in that it mostly deals with streetwear brands, probably the most popular sample sale site among ""laymen"" of the fashion world

For the bottom you could just wear, for the whole monochrome look, some black shorts. It's simple but effective.\n\nSome colours just work, dont try to get to many into one fit, they'll mess it up.

I Want To Start A Christian Streetwear Brand. I Need Your Thoughts!	This thread is not for religious debate so please don't make it one. As of now this is simply an idea in my head. I am personally a Christian, but I don't have a problem wearing brands such as Black Scale once in a while as long as the symbolism isn't too occult-like. I want my brand to have the same feel. I doubt many of you are delved into occult practices tied to Black Scale symbolism, but you still wear the brand. I would love to see people who aren't religious wearing this, simply because of the aesthetics. I want to use heavy symbolism and I might even use this as a way to take stands AGAINST modern day organized religion.

I think that the whole idea of organized religion and fellowship has changed so much over time that now it pushes people away from it. Instead of followers of Christ, you\'re now this sect or that sect. We\'ve pretty much drawn spiritual battle lines. I know that a large number of sects of today are practically the same, but I\'ve been to a few churches where they actually demonize other sects beliefs. The only reason I call myself a Christian is for the fact that I attend a Christian church. When talking to people I always let them know that my sect sits below my beliefs. For the general church goer it\'s the other way around. They let their sect determine their practices and beliefs. I met a preacher that has preached many times over the one on one relationship with God and how that should stand above any building or sect name you glamorize. I think at this point it\'s like claiming a political party. If you tell someone you\'re Catholic for example, they\'re automatically going to have a preconceived idea of you belief set. \n\nThat being said I want this brand to be designed in a way which will portray nothing but a belief in God. I don\'t want people to see it and be able to associate it with a certain sect of religion. I also want it to be unique enough that it will have people asking about it. When people ask all that you will have to say is, ""This stands for my belief."" It won\'t stand for Christianity. It won\'t stand for Catholicism. It won\'t stand for Protestantism. It will simply stand for belief.\n\nThanks for the info about the Chi Rho. I really want to use the symbol because it would be great for a brand logo, but the fact that it\'s based from Catholicism makes it hard. I might try to tweak and alter it to make it my own.

Prediction: as Kanye transcends into dad-life, he's going to make dad-core trendy and cool.	"Disclaimer: I'm on mobile, so I apologize for the link:

http://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/zayn-malik-pushes-style-boundaries-5948355

Pictured in the middle of the article is Kanye West rocking a rather *dad-ish* outfit. Now, it obviously looks good, albeit simple: cream long sleeve with a wider neckline, ripped stonewash jeans and his Chelsea boots.

Now, it's no mystery that Kanye is a fashion icon and has thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of followers who emulate (and sometimes even immitate) his style.

Would it be a far reach to predict that, as Kanye becomes older and more mature, his fits will reflect his lifestyle? With another kid on the way, and plenty of artistic (and business) ventures to explore, Kanye might eventually depart from the streetwear realm entirely and **actually make dadcore look cool**.

What does it mean for the fashion community? Well, while there are plenty of younger users in the various fashion forums in the Internet, there are also plenty of adult men becoming fathers or father-figures in the upcoming years. Who best to find inspiration for your next outfit than the coolest dad around?

I think (and hope) that within the next ten years, there would be an in*flex* of dads stunting on each other as they emulate the cool dads of fashion."	0	https://www.reddit.com/r/streetwear/comments/3b40v3/prediction_as_kanye_transcends_into_dadlife_hes/	KlausFenrir	2015-06-25 20:04:02	No images	"[{'author': 'dabludclaating', 'body': 'Hes dressing pretty similar to how he usually does.

Im sick of r/streetwear	Everyone needs to off of all these brand name dick just cause it has a logo if the company... That doesn't make a good outfit.

First try at an outfit, do I such at this?		0	http://m.imgur.com/hkCHGWa	I_not_Jofish	2015-07-03 18:00:29	No images	"[{'author': 'TheSecondAccountYeah', 'body': ""Alright man, you're on the right track. You're doing what a lot of people don't do, you want to improve your wardrobe. That's great. Now, I want you to know that everything I'm saying is completely my opinion, and should be taken as so. If you don't like it, that's totally cool. My advice would be to check the sidebar for essentials (on mobile can't link) and start there. \n\nBetter fitting pants are a necessity. If you don't want to spend a ton of money on pants, go ahead and take some jeans to the tailor and get them fitted better. I'm talking a smaller hem on the ankle, around 6 inches. Just make sure you can squeeze your foot through. Hem from the knee to the ankle, because worst case scenario is that the pants are too long and you get some nice stacking. Naked and Famous, Nudies, APC, and Acne have good quality denim too if you're looking to purchase more jeans. These are slightly expensive, so if you want to start cheaper, some people buy represent jeans. Still good quality, but a slightly better price tag. \n\nNext, the shirt. A white t shirt is great to have. Now buy 10 more. If you're wearing a jacket in July, I'm assuming you're either in the UK, northern USA, or below the equator and it's winter. Either way, a nice jacket or 4 is good to have. Check out grailed.com for some good deals, obviously north faces are great too. Black jackets, olive bombers, grey hoodies, etc., you name it. Generally in streetwear, darker colors are used a lot. Not to say that you can't wear bright colors, but some dark colors are always nice and simple. Supreme is a nice brand if you're into it, check out /r/supremeclothing for more info there. \n\nYour haircut is totally up to you, don't even worry about what others say about it unless you haven't had a cut in months and it's super shaggy or something. If you're wanting a new cut, there's lots of info on /r/streetwear and male fashion advice. \n\nEdit: I also used to work at chick fil a, hated that shit.

~$ 30 Challenge	"Seriously, I really like crocs and I've incorporated into my style. There's a lot of hate towards the clogs, but I think theirs just this corny connotation with the product of crocs. I personally think they are comfortable and look pretty good too. Even got complemented by a cute chick about the crocs and confidence.
Main reason I have them is because I use them for shower shoes. 

*Trust, you need shower shoes when you live on a aircraft carrier that has only communal showers.

Back to topic

The challenge: Try wearing crocs and finding a casual streetwear fit. Something you could rock doing anything non athletic.

I posted specifically on r/streetwear because other than following trends, we have to at least try for other looks. I always thought street wear was being able to show off a certain piece. The right amount of flex so you can look good while also varying in style.

I hoping this post will become more than a list of comments saying kys.
Or comment link to a fit which is just a pic of a noose.

Should I Get Grills?	Been thinking about getting custom grills (8 top, 6 bottom / 14k white gold) for around $600. Asked some friends, all of them advised against getting grills because I'm not black nor a rapper haha. I personally don't think I need to be black or a rapper to rock grills. What do you guys think? You think a Persian nigga could rock grills? Also will I give off a dickish vibe wearing grills in public? I don't like showing off per say, I just like how grills look but I'm worried that people would get the wrong idea if I wear grills haha.  	0	https://www.reddit.com/r/streetwear/comments/4itozx/should_i_get_grills/	None	2016-05-11 06:45:33	No images	"[{'author': 'ASVP23', 'body': ""Do you have any other jewelry?

Rule 2 Update! Please read.	"Rule number 2 has been now extended to comments as well.

Now this has always kind of been the case but now it is officially in the rules that memes and low effort content in comments are now a temp bannable offense.

To be more specific, if you are caught typing like T H I S, using emojis, posting copypastas then you could be temporarily suspended from posting. Memewear, memecore, memeshoes, memeshirt. All of the mentioned words and similar *""words** fall under this rule as well and could lead to a temporary suspension. 

The purpose of this announcement is to try and be as specific as possible so that no one should unknowingly break the rules and then we all have a bad time.

Thank you everyone for reading and cooperating with the rules set in place. If you'd like please use this thread as a suggestion box or to address an issue not pertaining to this update."	0	https://www.reddit.com/r/streetwear/comments/5moy7v/rule_2_update_please_read/	BigAssFashionSense	2017-01-08 04:04:53	No images	"[{'author': 'bajosmoove', 'body': ""This is a shitty way to try to fix the sub, but I guess it's the lesser of two evils "", 'score': 47, 'created_utc': '2017-01-08 04:09:07'}, {'author': 'EmArKay_11', 'body': ""this sub is a meme don't act like it can crawl out of the hole its dug itself into. ^but ^seriously ^this ^is ^a ^lighthearted ^place ^and ^I ^respect ^most ^of ^the ^changes, ^just ^make ^sure ^it ^isn't ^taken ^too ^far."", 'score': 36, 'created_utc': '2017-01-08 04:11:05'}, {'author': 'patsfan5101', 'body': '*T H A T S A S H I T R U L E*', 'score': 23, 'created_utc': '2017-01-08 06:12:48'}, {'author': 'dryicebryce', 'body': 'Yall just gotta chill.
