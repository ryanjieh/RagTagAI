How might I summarise a social media threads, complete with interaction metrics, into a list of fashion suggestions for OP?

This paper suggests that T5 is a good pre-trained model for summarising social media summaries. In particular they state that pre-processing is necessary to remove non-substantive comments and links etc. 
Their data only includes the number of comments below it, the comment content and a unique id

_________

To do: Make a script to add to Joseph’s, to 
take his image link and convert to a numpy array
Get a list of suggestions as well as sentiment analysis of the reddit post – figure out how to use t5 to answer questions on json. It is attempting to answer but giving gibberish
Collect the as a dataset to train a clip model to match the image to suggestions
